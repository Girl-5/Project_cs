Back in her family house, she starts to sort out all the objects of her childhood. 
At some point, she sees an upsetting photograph: children smiling in a kindergarten playground. On the edge of the frame there is a little girl sitting on a bench, looking shyly at the camera. 

This picture is the only image of her childhood, the only memory her mother could give to her. But Asmae is convinced that she’s not the child on this picture. Hoping to make her parents talk, Asmae introduces her camera and plays with this intimate incident to talk about other memories that she doesn’t trust either. This photo, a sensitive subject, becomes the starting point of an investigation during which the director questions all the little lies told by her family: is her mother saying the truth about the picture ? Has her father really built with his own hands the Lion of Ifrane ? Does her grandmother say the truth about Asmae’s job and why does she prefer to tell everyone that she’s a journalist? 

Behind the walls of the house, there is also the neighborhood. And Asmae remembers…
The local politician, Sir Abdelkader: is he the generous man offering hammam, meat and plums to the neighborhood or a corrupt politician ? 
Little by little, Asmae explores the memory of her own people - either real or surreal - together with the memory of her neighborhood and country. 

What’s real in this reconstructed story made out of fragmented childhood memories ? 
As the lies grow bigger, the director discovers something strange. She discovers a cemetery not far from their home and the strange story of bodies that disappeared 38 years before: the “Bread Riot”. The story of a popular uprising, violently repressed in that neighborhood during Hassan II Dark Years.  
Surrounded by her parents and neighbors, Asmae creates links between her childhood photo and the Bread Riot on June 20th 1981. 

";s:22:"characters_description";s:1997:"Ouarda El Moudir	

Ouarda is Asmae’s model since her childhood. She was always the one hiding secrets to better protect the family. Mystery and lies are for her a way to better preserve family’s balance and to comfort her daughter. Grounded in the present and knowing that the quest for truth doesn’t really exist, she invents stories against her will and prefers to avoid political subjects. First daughter-in-law to enter the El Moudir family circle, she suffered from her mother in law’s rejection and from her strict principles. With Asmae, talks are always very lively even though they are very close. If she starts refusing to talk about her lies, she finally agrees to make the film when she discovers that she won’t be the only one to do so. She decided to move out from Casablanca to go live in the countryside around Salé.

Asmae El Moudir	
			
Asmae’s character is a mix between the twelve years old girl she was, spontaneous and innocent, embodied in the film by her miniature character, and the 30 years old woman she is today: a rebel director who chooses to look for truth whatever it costs. Youngest daughter in the family, Asmae is very close from her parents and grandmother. Searching for traces of her past and identity, she gathers little family history with big national history. She decides to use all her energy to understand lies, even if this sometimes means fighting with your loved ones.

Mohammed El Moudir
Mohammed is his daughter’s hero. Tender, he always uses irony and emphasizes his stories to better shine before his daughter’s eyes. He is a mason and restored almost all the walls of his neighborhood in Casablanca, except his own walls. In contrast to his wife, he lives in the past and likes words better than action. 

Zahara 

Zahara is Asmae’s grandmother. She’s a 87 years old woman who was always very mysterious about her origins. 
She lived a difficult life and a very poor childhood. Married when she was very young.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2027:"After some years abroad, I return to the heart of the family home and neighbourhood of Casablanca where I grew up, to help my parents move out. Leaving this neighborhood filled with historical events in order to go live far from city center is a new start for my parents. And it’s a good way for me to introduce my camera in the house and question them about the mysterious photo of my childhood to better find the truth behind it. 

The importance of memory in my work

This discovery of the Bread Riot brings back a memory: when I’m a little girl, I remember my mother telling me the most traumatising day of her life. On a Saturday morning in Casablanca, military bullets are flying everywhere and take almost her life and my big brother Ahmed’s life. Why did she never tell me the details and reasons of this riot? I’m pissed at my parents because they kept me in the dark and told me nothing about this event that they’ve been through personally.

While I’m watching the news, I’m particularly moved by the portraits of the disappeared ones, hold by the parents to the camera. One of them especially catches my attention: a woman with a sad look holds with both hands a black and white portrait of a gracious young lady. Her long black hair, her thin face and her black eyes give her a serious look. Her name is Fatima. This twelve years old girl died on June 20th 1981 in the very same streets where I was playing carelessly during my youth. 
The Image’s issue

The image’s issue seems to be an appropriate and relevant way to talk about my country. From Bread Riot there is only one photo that survived through all these years. A black and white picture with people dead on the streets. All the others were destroyed in order to better organize official speech. There are no national archives in Morocco.
