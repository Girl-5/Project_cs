Mais un matin, après une discussion avec son amie Flora qui vit désormais en Tunisie, les idées de Cris-Israel basculent. Le jeune futur cadre de la santé ne pense plus qu’à une seule chose ; partir en Europe via la Tunisie. Le 3 Avril 2019, à 22 heures, Cris-Israel, dans plus grand secret, décolle pour la Tunisie. Il abandonne derrière lui, ses études, son avenir et ses deux filles. Il débarque à Tunis le lendemain où Flora et Didi l’accueillent. Ses deux hôtes lui proposent d’échanger son argent de poche contre la monnaie locale. La somme de 300 mille francs CFA. Il ne verra plus jamais cet argent. Plutôt que de le conduire à l’hôtel qu’on lui a fait réserver depuis Abidjan, Cris-Israel est emmené dans une petite pièce un peu reculée de la ville. Intrigué, il cherche à comprendre.

As a daughter and filmmaker, Asmae fuses personal and national history as she reflects on the 1981 Bread R";s:15:"story_structure";s:2033:"It’s summertime and young Moroccan director Asmae goes to her parents’ place in Casablanca to help them move out. Back in her family house, she starts to sort out all the objects of her childhood. 
At some point, she sees an upsetting photograph: children smiling in a kindergarten playground. On the edge of the frame there is a little girl sitting on a bench, looking shyly at the camera. 

This picture is the only image of her childhood, the only memory her mother could give to her. But Asmae is convinced that she’s not the child on this picture. Hoping to make her parents talk, Asmae introduces her camera and plays with this intimate incident to talk about other memories that she doesn’t trust either. This photo, a sensitive subject, becomes the starting point of an investigation during which the director questions all the little lies told by her family: is her mother saying the truth about the picture ? Has her father really built with his own hands the Lion of Ifrane ? Does her grandmother say the truth about Asmae’s job and why does she prefer to tell everyone that she’s a journalist? 

Behind the walls of the house, there is also the neighborhood. And Asmae remembers…
The local politician, Sir Abdelkader: is he the generous man offering hammam, meat and plums to the neighborhood or a corrupt politician ? 
Little by little, Asmae explores the memory of her own people - either real or surreal - together with the memory of her neighborhood and country. 

What’s real in this reconstructed story made out of fragmented childhood memories ? 
As the lies grow bigger, the director discovers something strange. She discovers a cemetery not far from their home and the strange story of bodies that disappeared 38 years before: the “Bread Riot”. The story of a popular uprising, violently repressed in that neighborhood during Hassan II Dark Years.  
Surrounded by her parents and neighbors, Asmae creates links between her childhood photo and the Bread Riot on June 20th 1981. 

";s:22:"characters_description";s:1997:"Ouarda El Moudir	

Ouarda is Asmae’s model since her childhood. She was always the one hiding secrets to better protect the family. Mystery and lies are for her a way to better preserve family’s balance and to comfort her daughter. Grounded in the present and knowing that the quest for truth doesn’t really exist, she invents stories against her will and prefers to avoid political subjects. First daughter-in-law to enter the El Moudir family circle, she suffered from her mother in law’s rejection and from her strict principles. With Asmae, talks are always very lively even though they are very close. If she starts refusing to talk about her lies, she finally agrees to make the film when she discovers that she won’t be the only one to do so. She decided to move out from Casablanca to go live in the countryside around Salé.

Asmae El Moudir	
			
Asmae’s character is a mix between the twelve years old girl she was, spontaneous and innocent, embodied in the film by her miniature character, and the 30 years old woman she is today: a rebel director who chooses to look for truth whatever it costs. Youngest daughter in the family, Asmae is very close from her parents and grandmother. Searching for traces of her past and identity, she gathers little family history with big national history. She decides to use all her energy to understand lies, even if this sometimes means fighting with your loved ones.

Mohammed El Moudir
Mohammed is his daughter’s hero. Tender, he always uses irony and emphasizes his stories to better shine before his daughter’s eyes. He is a mason and restored almost all the walls of his neighborhood in Casablanca, except his own walls. In contrast to his wife, he lives in the past and likes words better than action. 

Zahara 

Zahara is Asmae’s grandmother. She’s a 87 years old woman who was always very mysterious about her origins. 
She lived a difficult life and a very poor childhood. Married when she was very young.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2027:"After some years abroad, I return to the heart of the family home and neighbourhood of Casablanca where I grew up, to help my parents move out. Leaving this neighborhood filled with historical events in order to go live far from city center is a new start for my parents. And it’s a good way for me to introduce my camera in the house and question them about the mysterious photo of my childhood to better find the truth behind it. 

The importance of memory in my work

This discovery of the Bread Riot brings back a memory: when I’m a little girl, I remember my mother telling me the most traumatising day of her life. On a Saturday morning in Casablanca, military bullets are flying everywhere and take almost her life and my big brother Ahmed’s life. Why did she never tell me the details and reasons of this riot? I’m pissed at my parents because they kept me in the dark and told me nothing about this event that they’ve been through personally.

While I’m watching the news, I’m particularly moved by the portraits of the disappeared ones, hold by the parents to the camera. One of them especially catches my attention: a woman with a sad look holds with both hands a black and white portrait of a gracious young lady. Her long black hair, her thin face and her black eyes give her a serious look. Her name is Fatima. This twelve years old girl died on June 20th 1981 in the very same streets where I was playing carelessly during my youth. 
The Image’s issue

The image’s issue seems to be an appropriate and relevant way to talk about my country. From Bread Riot there is only one photo that survived through all these years. A black and white picture with people dead on the streets. All the others were destroyed in order to better organize official speech. There are no national archives in Morocco. All the existing documents were neglected or retrieved by Institutions that belong to the Royal Cabinet, still under political control.

Dans ce périple, nous allons rencontrer des chanteurs juifs originaires du Maroc et provenant de trois pays différents, ce qui constitue trois styles musicaux distincts.

C’est un parcours qui passe par l’Espagne, l’Israël et le Maroc, et dont le fil conducteur est la musique juive, interprétée par des Juifs d’origine marocaine. 
Le film est une manière de rendre hommage à une grande partie de l’histoire du Maroc qui s’est rétrécit en quelques ruelles étroites connues comme « Mellahs ».
Je vais essayer de réinstaurer ces liens historiques, à travers notamment la musique juive, cette musique qui a favorisé, au long de plus de deux mille cinq cents ans, le dialogue culturel entre les différentes composantes de la société marocaine, dont la majorité ont déjà abandonné le Maroc pour s’installer en Israël, mais tout en gardant présents les principales caractéristiques qui identifient la culture marocaine, surtout au niveau du chant.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:2111:"LALA TAMAR
Dans l’une des ruelles de Jaffa, qui me rappellent celles de Fès, je retrouve la chanteuse Tamar Bloch Amar, connue par Lala Tamar, avec une Djellaba multicolore reflétant ses origines marocaines.

Nous prenons ses ruelles pour nous diriger vers son appartement qui est en réalité un studio. Une fois arrivés, des meubles en bois décorant l’entrée du studio sautent aux yeux, en plus d’un élégant piano et de tissus marocains multicolores ornant les murs, ainsi qu’un ordinateur posé sur une table en bois. Tout cela m’a fait oublier les distances qui me séparent du Maroc, et m’a donné la sensation de chaleur familiale.
Elle m’a préparé du thé et en ce moment, elle a commencé à chantonner les mélodies de sa chanson la plus connue en Haketia. Celle-ci est bien la chanson que j’aime le plus. 
Je l’ai écouté jusqu’à la fin et puis je lui ai demandé de m’expliquer ses paroles, elle m’a dit qu’il s’agit d’une histoire d’amour vécue à Tétouan, au nord du Maroc…

Elle me parle de l’amour qu’elle a pour la Haketia grâce notamment à ses origines, puisque sa mère est née au Maroc.
Je l’interrompe, pourquoi la langue de la Haketia, tandis qu’il existe plusieurs chanteurs juifs qui ont choisi de chanter en anglais ou tout simplement en hébreu, ce qui aide à viser un grand public…

MOR KARBASI
Lors de notre promenade, nous écoutons une voix poétique divine (nous saurons par la suite que c’est la voix de l’héroïne de notre deuxième voyage- Mor Karbasi). Peu après, Mor Karbasi me dit qu’à chaque fois qu’elle visite ce quartier ancien, elle sent qu’il manque de quelque chose de précieux, certaines choses que l’Espagne aurait perdues. C’est un sentiment vague certes, mais je suis en mesure de le sentir, sentir que la composante culturelle manque quelque part, sentir le vide et l’absence…
Elle réplique que la musique chantée par les personnes déplacées de Grenade vers l’Afrique du nord ou les réfugiés juifs résidant en Grenade est chargée de nostalgie et du désir.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1658:"           Pour que le film soit présenté sous une forme provisoire et afin que ceci nous guide lors de l’étape de préparation, je propose que sa construction se base sur trois saisons ou séquences-mouvements. Ce schéma général peut être modifiable lors la rédaction, tournage ou montage, et ce en se basant sur les différentes rencontres menées avec les trois protagonistes du film ou encore sur les rencontres de ces derniers avec des personnages secondaires, c’est ainsi que le parcours général du voyage sera conçu.

Il est possible de regrouper les séquences du film en trois mouvements/voyages vers :

L’Israël ;

L’Espagne ;

Le Maroc.

Qu’on peut traduire ou expliquer à travers :

La quête des chanteurs juifs originaires du Maroc et installés en Israël.
Le voyage de la Grenade nous a permis de découvrir de près la musique gharnatie et la poésie séfarade, ainsi que la façon dont elles ont pu traduire l’essence de l’exode depuis Grenade vers le Maroc. C’est un style musical qui se caractérise par sa mélancolie et tristesse.
 Le film ne représente pas la transmigration de façon négative, bien qu’à l’époque, elle a toujours été liée aux malheurs et aux tristesses. Au contraire, il l’a tracé comme étant un élément positif d’un point de vue musical, puisqu’il a contribué à l’enrichissement du répertoire musical juif et à son métissage avec la culture du nord du Maroc, c’est exactement ce qui apparait dans la troisième partie relative au troisième voyage traitant du Maroc. 
Le film adopte la méthode du cinéma direct en termes de réalisation.

Les miliciens du Mouvement de libération du Congo (MLC), de Jean-Pierre Bemba qui ont prêté main forte, se sont livrés, sans retenue et avec enthousiasme, à des actes d’exactions. Cette période a été la plus sombre que l'on ne puisse imaginer. Les armes ont circulé, les larmes ont coulé, des vies ont été perdues et des crimes commis. Ces hommes ont commis des crimes contre la population civile et, en particulier, des viols qui ont bouleversé la vie de nombreuses femmes. S’ensuit les évènements de 2013 et 2015 qui ne font qu’en rajouter. Ce sont les femmes qui en ont payé les lourdes  conséquences. Beaucoup de celles qui sont victimes d’exactions, en particulier du viol, ne veulent pas se faire entendre.

En peu de temps, elle a vu sa rivale sur le point d'accoucher être éventrée, leur mari tué, sa famille brûlée à vif et son petit garçon éventré dans la forêt. Un cauchemar qu’on croirait lire dans un roman de fiction. Pono a pu voir la pierre qui lui a été enlevée dans le sex après 6 dures et difficiles interventions chirurgicales.

";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2066:"“I Londo awe”(titre provisoire du film) sera un docu-fiction de 75 min. Nous ferons une reconstitution de certaines scènes vécues, qui sont marquant de leur histoire, afin de montrer par quoi elles sont passées. Caméra à la main pour des scènes vivantes et en mouvement, caméra fixes sur pied pour des interviews, nous allons habiller certaines de nos images par des voix off de nos personnages dans certaines situations dans le but de les protéger et ne pas les exposer. 

Nous visons pour “I Londo awe” à faire vivre au spectateur les mêmes émotions que nos personnages, à l'immerger dans son monde et à s'attacher à lui au fil de l'histoire. Visuellement, rien ne vaut d'être dans un film avec le personnage. C'est ce sentiment que nous aimerions le plus transmettre au spectateur. Pour cela, nous utiliserons les gros plans sur nos personnages principaux pendant leur journée, leurs activités quotidiennes pour entrer dans leur monde. Pour cela, nous nous inspirons du film Arbre Sans Fruit de Aïcha Macky dont nous avons étudié la cinématographie. Ce langage cinématographique intime permet aux spectateurs d’accompagner les personnages dans leur mouvement quotidien, de suivre l'évolution de leur histoire en temps réel en totalité. Lorsque les sujets arrivent à de nouvelles destinations, notre caméra se rapproche au plus près, après avoir établi les plans d’ensemble. Ces gros plans extrêmes relient le spectateur aux émotions de nos sujets, à leur voyage intérieur. 
Nous savons ce que l'on ressent lorsqu'on est méprisé ou que l'on est perçu comme quelqu'un de moins capable, qui ne sert plus à rien. Nous allons filmer et raconter cette histoire avec dignité, en montrant les efforts et sacrifices de nos personnages, du fait que nous savons ce que cela représente, ayant vécu par nous-même des considérations similaires de la part des autres. Cette sensibilité ne peut pas être truquée ou créée, c'est quelque chose qui est là et qui va être révélé à l'écran de manière subtile.

Je me positionne comme un maillon de la chaîne et non pas la pièce maîtresse. La priorité est donnée à mes interlocuteurs.

Ce premier épisode  intitulé « de l’Indépendance au crise de 1991 », va parler de l’indépendance  en 1960 , du premier président Philibert Tsiranana , et de la naissance même de la nation Malagasy .

Un évènement conduisant à la désignation du «  Président Rouge » l’Amiral Didier Ratsiraka et à ses 23 ans au pouvoir de la République Malgache.

Didier Ratsiraka est un président Communiste, ami de François Mitterrand et Mercenaire Robert Denard. Il est aussi très proche du pouvoir Communiste Chinois, du Kremlin de Cuba de Castro, ainsi que de la Lybie de Khadafi qui est son ami fidèle. De 1975 a 1991 commence la construction Massif de logements sociaux, d’Universités et d’infrastructures Routiers à Madagascar.

Les antennes radio de l’ANC ont pu émettre depuis Madagascar sur les ondes Hertzienne et les rumeurs sur sa rencontre avec le Président  Frederik De Klerk pour la Libération de Nelson Mandela lui ont valu le respect du monde entier.

C’est un jeune homme qui à gouté à plusieurs vies,  et qui a jonglée entre universitaire, travailleur sociaux, élève policier ,etc…puis qui à sombré petit à petit dans la misère la plus totale. Sa seule échappatoire sera le texte, sa poésie, pour le transporter dans un rêve où il y a un pays libre et surtout un pays bon à vivre. Mais ce n’est que Utopie.

La  Guinée dans sa Région forestière, est l’habitat actuel des ethnies Kpèlè et Konia parmi tant d’autre. Tous anciennement animistes pendant des siècles, ces ethnies sont aujourd’hui à la croisé des religions monothéistes dont les Kpèlè majoritairement chrétien ainsi que les Konia majoritairement musulman.

Ces deux ethnies entretiennent aujourd’hui un climat de haine démesuré dont on ignore encore les raisons. Cette haine qui se manifeste par le repli identitaire et la méfiance entre eux, a occasionné une forte opposition contre l’union conjugale de Gervais HABA jeune cinéaste âgé de 32 ans, né de l’ethnie Kpèlè et Mariam SACKO jeune fille de 27 ans, diplômée en gestion touristique licence (3), née de l’ethnie Konia. 

Mais quelles  peuvent bien être les raisons de cette opposition ? Qu’elles peuvent être les difficultés rencontrées par ces deux amoureux alors qu’ils ont déjà fait un enfant qui coure vers ses deux ans ? Comment parviendront-ils à vivre leur véritable histoire d’amour déjà fortement controversée par le père de Mariam SACKO?
A travers les étapes préparatoires de ce mariage incertain, on va essayer de faire ressortir les différents conflits dans la rencontre des deux familles, les responsables religieux, les sages des différents peuples et quelques témoins qui vivent les mêmes réalités qu’ils empruntent déjà, afin d’interpeler les acteurs de  ses différentes rancœurs qui favorisent chaque fois un climat de désastres.

Je compte sur leur spontanéité pour dynamiser la dramaturgie du récit lorsque nos discussions seront  intenses car je n’ai pas non plus évoqué avec eux ma propre histoire que je suis entrain de vivre déjà.  

Le rythme que je donnerai à nos entretiens amènera sans doute des silences qui exprimeront autant que les paroles. J’utiliserai une image assez large quand nos discussions seront seulement informatives. Les gros plans seront utilisés lorsque  nos échanges seront plus émotionnels. 
La plus part des scènes se dérouleront en extérieur, dans les lieux où ils ont vécu les évènements historiques qu’ils nous narrent. Ces décors seront choisis en fonction de leur esthétisme, et de la charge historique, émotionnelle et dramaturgique qu’ils portent en eux.

Kinshasa. Capital of the D.R.Congo. I have been dreaming about this city for two decades from my home town of Goma, 1500 km away. If it fascinated me to the point of moving there at the end of 2013, it is largely because of the way its 18 million inhabitants conceive life. In Kinshasa, problems, crises and disasters are nothing more than trials, and the struggle of the population is to find a " way of not surrendering " to a given trial. Thus, "Nzonzing" (Developed resourcefulness), "sapology" (the cult of dress and elegance), "mabanga" (payable dedications), "matolo" (made-up begging), etc. are, among many others, ingenious ways of not giving in to institutionalized chaos. 

The background of this film will be the realities of the first 3 years of this regime, which was born of the first peaceful alternation of the presidency of the republic. Presented as "civilized," much hope was placed in this noble gesture that saw for the first time ever a sitting president (M. Kabila) hand over the baton of leadership to an elected president (M. Tshisekedi). 

The story will be bolstered by the character’s poetry - both savory and zany - with which Lordi, Andria, Patrick and Enoch perpetually reinvent their "way of not surrendering". 

The narrative structure will have 3 layers. 
- The 1st layer is that of 4 stories. One story per main character. Narratives that are so close together that they will make and unmake each other and, ultimately, turn into one and the same story. A portrait of the group. 
- The 2nd is that of a “stop and go” cycle choregraphy. A choregraphy that will fix the group’s career, the journey of each member and the movement of bodies’s occupation of space. 
- The last one is that of a two-part journey : A physical ride made by the four characters every day to survive and an interior journey which brings them to the evidence long denied.

";s:22:"characters_description";s:2019:"Kinshasa is divided into two physical parts. The city center and the "cité". The city center is inhabited by the rich and the "cité" by the poor. "Cité" is short for the part that was called the "cité indigène" in colonial times.  Today it is home to 80 percent of the population. Living conditions are precarious and the infrastructure is either dilapidated or non-existent. It is in this atypical universe that Andria, Lordi, Enoch and Patrick live. Four young men, funny, creative and dynamic. They are the main characters of this film. 

They are a group of itinerant comedians who, in addition to their basic work, are constantly looking for a project that will immediately improve their living conditions. 10 years have passed since they created their group and since they tried several projects, hoping that each of them would be the saving project. The passage of time was not a problem for them as long as they could survive with the little they earned and as long as they did not turn to banditry like many young people from the "cité". Working as a itinerant comedian has always been a kind of outlet for them. Once disguised for the need of this work, Andria, Lordi, Enoch and Patrick adopt a character of “superhero”. Nothing affects them anymore. On the other hand, since they became parents everything has changed. They now have to take care of their wife and children. Hence the immediate obligation of results. It is from the moment they question their way of perceiving their work that the action of this film begins. 

They constitute a group that, like the "Beatles", does not prevent the personality of each of them from unfolding.

- An idealist, Enoch firmly believes in the advent of success that will change his life. 
- Leader, Lordi takes care of his image even if it means hiding his problems
- Mature, Patrick, father of three children, no longer has time to dream
- Disillusioned and entangled in a bunch of problems since birth, Andria uses the group to keep believing.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:905:"The film NZONZING will use direct cinema techniques. The archives that will be used in it, will be initially introduced by the characters. The traditional media will be used to define the socio-political and economic realities of the place where the story takes place. 

The city of Kinshasa, which is a character in itself, will be filmed in such a way as to juxtapose its two physical parts. 

When edited, the images of the city centre will be dull and fast paced and those of the city will be vivid with a fast pace to allow for the easy deployment of each action. 

The sound will move beyond its status as an image confirmation element to come to the foreground in some scenes in a wide and fixed shot or in a sequence shot to define a cut. 

The music will be based on percussion. Its primary function will not be to accompany, highlight or propose emotions, it will play a part in itself. ";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:782:"About co-production. We received a proposal from the Canadian company QUIET REVOLUTION PRODUCTIONS inc. managed by Mr. Michael Dobbin. After analyzing the budget, this company has committed to contribute first with an amount of 15773 Euros. In the meantime, Mr. Michael Dobbin and his team are studying the possibilities of mobilizing other funds in Canada and in the USA. 

About distribution. QUIET REVOLUTION PRODUCTIONS inc. has made an offer from its subsidiary CAPITAL MOTION PICTURE GROUP to distribute the film alongside the company MAZIWA MAKUU FILMS of Ms. DJIA MAMBU. 

In addition, the project NZONZING will be presented at this year's DURBAN FILMMART. We are counting on this opportunity to attract other partners capable of helping us to materialize this project. ";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:2008:"I met them for the first time one afternoon in December 2018 while I was sitting on the terrace of a bar on the edge of Nyangwe Avenue (not far from the downtown). Andria, Lordi, Enoch and Patrick appeared in front of me and made me laugh with the jokes they were telling with application and frenzy. Impressed, I found myself obliged to give them some money before returning home praising their courage and genius. Their "way not to surrender" seemed to me to be a good answer to the unemployment that affects seventy percent of the Congolese. 

Curiously, I couldn't forget them. Their grim faces, their big brightly colored glasses, their laughter, the color of their beards, their false bloated bellies, their looks of superheroes ... Thinking about it, I began to wonder about the durability of their work and the nature of their mask in this city where appearance is an important social indicator. 

When I saw them again, I learned that they were a group of four itinerant comedians, that they lived in the "city" but worked exclusively in the downtown. This means that in order to work they have to cross fifteen kilometres each day, both on the outward and return journey. Their basic work consists of grimacing their faces and wearing grotesque outfits before criss-crossing the downtown, its surroundings, its bars and terraces to tell jokes and funny stories to people they meet. Sometimes these people give them a little money. That money is their gain.

Andria, Lordi, Enoch and Patrick develop projects, both ambitious and daring, and carry them out. If one project does not produce the desired results, they get together to find another. In the meantime, while waiting for a new project to be executed, they continue their core work as itinerant comedians. This basic work is the only one that so far has helped them to support themselves and the people for whom they are responsible. 

These four men alone crystallize the fears and vicissitudes of a youth abandoned to its sad fate.";s:14:"representation";s:2008:"The noun "Nzonzing" is used in Kinshasa slang to mean a sideline or extra activity, whether or not it is related to a person's main activity. No other word carries the subject of this film better than this timeless, anodyne noun.  

The Nzonzing film file we submit to you is not just a file, it is the emanation of a filmmaking device that took several months to clarify and a trivialized social phenomenon that, in our opinion, best defines the local society in which we live.

In 2018 Moimi Wezam released his first film entitled ZERO. This 66-minute documentary is in itself a sort of tribute to the late Papa Wemba (the only Congolese musical artist, to date, certified gold record in the United States). When on April 24, 2016, in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Papa Wemba's unexpected death occurred, his dancer Benedicte Shutsha (who worked for him for fifteen years) was devastated. During his mourning, little by little, the idea of remixing the song ZERO of his late mentor became clear in his head. A perilous project whose objective was both to pay tribute to her former employer and to launch her singing career. The ups and downs of this adventure, Benedicte Shutsha's difficulties in finding her place as the heir to an African music icon and the fact that this project could help her mourn her loss served as the first hinges of the narrative for what became the film ZERO. 

A film with a steady pace whose first objective was to share with the audience the feeling of stagnation that plagued Benedicte during her mourning and the way she struggled to get rid of it. To this first choice was added a voice-over in the first person singular in which was concentrated an important emotional thickness. 

Moimi Wezam is proud of the result and of ZERO's journey. He believed in it, he wrote it and he mobilized the means to materialize it. With hindsight, he is convinced that if he had participated in the rewriting programs at the development stage and if he had succeeded in mobilizing more";s:21:"representation_upload";s:21:"2021/1620936639_1.jpg";s:16:"contracts_upload";s:0:"";s:15:"artistic_upload";s:0:"";s:13:"visual_upload";s:0:"";s:12:"project_link";s:0:"";s:16:"project_password";s:0:"";s:8:"synopsis";s:0:"";s:13:"projectBudget";s:6:"361050";s:13:"financialPlan";s:0:"";s:12:"totalSecured";s:5:"73843";s:12:"totalApplied";s:6:"287208";s:11:"totalPening";s:1:"0";s:13:"BudgetDeficit";s:6:"287207";s:10:"budgetFile";s:0:"";s:9:"proofFile";s:0:"";s:13:"contractProof";s:0:"";s:12:"ackStatement";s:0:"";s:11:"submittedBy";s:11:"MOIMI WEZAM";s:12:"project_role";s:9:"filmmaker";s:10:"filmmanker";s:0:"";s:8:"producer";s:0:"";s:20:"project_co_ordinator";s:0:"";s:13:"project_role2";s:0:"";s:16:"project_category";s:0:"";s:13:"project_brief";s:0:"";s:16:"project_timeline";s:1:"0";s:16:"project_describe";s:0:"";s:12:"organisation";s:0:"";s:20:"explain_organisation";s:0:"";s:15:"briefly_explain";s:0:"";s:14:"socio_economic";s:0:"";s:10:"video_link";s:0:"";s:16:"description_link";s:0:"";s:20:"description_password";s:0:"";s:15:"proposal_upload";s:0:"";s:10:"project_co";s:1:"0";s:8:"complete";s:1:"1";s:6:"status";s:1:"3";s:5:"addon";s:19:"2023-06-23 14:39:33";s:5:"award";s:1:"1";}i:10;a:54:{s:2:"id";s:3:"111";s:8:"grant_id";s:2:"18";s:7:"user_id";s:2:"90";s:4:"name";s:43:"the tragedy of forced child labour in Benin";s:6:"p_date";s:2:"52";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:8:"e_length";s:5:"21-59";s:7:"logline";s:52:"La tragédie du travail forcé des enfants au Bénin";s:15:"story_structure";s:1155:"Au Bénin, en dépit de toutes les dispositions qui ont été prises à travers les articles 13 de la constitution de 1990 du Bénin, l’article 166 du code du travail de 1998 et la loi de 2006 portant sur le transport des mineurs et la répression de la traitre des enfants par le gouvernement contre la maltraitance des enfants, force est de constater que plusieurs enfants de - (moins) de 13 ans et de - (moins) de 18 ans continuent de travailler à outrance et d’une manière dangereuse en tant qu’ « enfants placés », apprenti dans les ménages, dans les ateliers et sur les chantiers de constructions.

The second chapter shows the current wave of mass migration whereby African youth with untapped potential are leaving in their thousands to look for a better life. This time young people are fleeing various post-colonial challenges in their countries. We follow a boat captain, Captain Abdourahmane Diop who facilitates the irregular migration these African youth are taking. 

The third and final chapter takes place in a seaside Catholic Mission in Nouadhibou headed by Bishop Martin Harpe. From time to time, the wreckages of boats carrying irregular migrants wash up on the shore near his mission. Not knowing whether the bodies are those of Christians, Muslims or non-believers, the local population is forbidden to touch them. Bishop Harpe has started a cemetery for these forgotten people as he does the work of giving last rites.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:965:"The Four major characters in this film are very interesting characters.

Character 1: Abdouramane Diop, he is a fixer and a captain who recruits and captain the boat to Spain. he is a serious business man and an angry Mauritanian who uses the excuse of the Government’s inability to provide jobs for its citizen as a yardstick to carry out his business.

Abu Tew is a Fixer and a recruiter whose business is to recruit migrants and when he has a sufficient number of migrants, he employs the services of a captain to take his boat to Spain.

Bishop Harpe is a Catholic Bishop who buries migrants’ bodies that washes off from the Mediterranean, he also caters for migrants who are stuck in the city of Nouadhibou in Mauritania.

Corner Stone is a tour guide at the Badagry Slave Museum in Lagos Nigeria, a Malian and a Rastafarian who have come to study the 6 parts of the museum and helps people to understand what happened during the slave trade era.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:537:"I intend to make use of symbolism to drive this story, there are lots of items that were used in the slave trade era that I can match up with today so that this project can reveal that the soul reason for slavery and migration of today is strictly for business which is stemmed by greed, power and laziness. This project will seek to juxtapose involuntary and voluntary migration. My artistic approach is to weave the story in a manner that depicts the greed that exists in these business venture in a subtle but creative cum poetic way.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:111:"So far, Business as Usual has been filmed upto 70-80% both in Nigeria and Mauritania and we intend to film more";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:1991:"Business as Usual is an expośe on the disturbing but growing activities of illegal voluntary migration through the dangerous Mediterranean route. This documentary focuses mainly on the business angle. 

At first, Africans were subdued and inhumanely dragged to become slaves in a foreign land. Fast forward to centuries later, same Africans would do anything humanly possible to end up in same countries, same situations. From the onset, migration rode on the back of greedy men, mostly Chieftains, Kings and men of caliber who would sell their subjects in exchange for mirror, canon guns, gins, umbrellas’ etc.

In recent time, it’s still the same, fixers would transport 120 people on an 80 people capacity boat just to make more money from one trip. But so as not to derail, we will be focusing on why this activity despite how dangerous it is has grown over the years and for where there is a way, there is a will. The way in this case is the first few minutes of the documentary which touches on involuntary migration, this translates to the slave trade era. Due to minimal available footages, we will be depicting the era with 2D illustrations. The illustrations will show the gruesome movement of Africans (slaves) through this route despite how dangerous it was, and still is. 

Cornerstone Eyanem, we will see the plights of slsves through the eyes of a Tour Guide at the Badagry slave museum (Point of No Return) with a couple of students on Excursion 

On the other part of my project, Captain Abou, a Mauritanian fixer/clandestine will take us through a journey of this deadly routes which migrants ply. I intend to see the migrants through the eyes of the fixer, thereby revealing their desperation and reason to travel out of Africa not minding the dangers of the Desert & the Mediterranean and also not minding how much they will spend to get to their destination, if they will ever get there.
In this part of the project, I intend to come up close and personal.";s:14:"representation";s:1364:"BUSINESS AS USUAL was birthed out of deep concern for the massive loss of lives in the Mediterranean.

A lot of stories have been told about Migration, mostly from the migration point of view or the migrant’s point of view, it’s rare to have a Migration story from the business point of view, Business As Usual as the title implies takes a critical look at how money changes hands from the migrant to the clandestine. It also juxtaposes involuntary migration during the slave trade era with the mass voluntary migration in recent times using money as a yardstick. It seeks to reveal the intentions of the clandestine, are they helping, are they genuine or are they there to make their money without minding if lives are lost or not, why do they overload the boats etc., Business as usual will seek to answer these questions.

The whole idea is to highlight the injustice meted out at slaves during the slave trade era and comparing it with the illegal migration of today through the Mediterranean, 'Imagine seeing a rusted Canon Gun on the floor at the Badagry Slave Museum and been told that the piece of metal was used in exchange for 60 able bodied and healthy people'

Business as Usual is an observational film but not in its entirety. The style of the documentary is poetic and cinematic and as the theme is on migration, which connotes movement.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:1978:"The female body has been many things and nothing through time. She has been bruised, battered, covered up, opened up, cut open. She has been trimmed, watered, pruned like a garden, she has been nourished like a fattened cow; she has flourished and has also withered away. 

This film will be a fascinating combination of archival materials showcasing the culture and practices of old as well as convincing interviews from scholars and emotional cinematography following the lives of our primary character; Lynda Okonkwo.

The beginning of the documentary will feature conceptualization; what is fat? What is beauty? Here, the scholars will take us on a journey through time from pre-colonial Nigeriansocieties and cultures through till modern times to give us a holistic understanding of African cultures surrounding beauty, fat, and the female body.

Next, we will follow the true-life story of our main character, Lyda Okonkwo, backing it up with the voices of selected women, to get their personal experiences of how cultural preferences of beauty have affected their life choices.
What will follow will be the reality of their life choices and how they have been living with these choices especially dealing with peer pressure, body shaming, and the evolving cultural perception of beauty. We will also hear from them, the limits they are going to readjust or reaffirm their bodies. Here, together with the personal experiences, interviews of industry professionals from clinical psychologists to gym instructors, will give us insights into body dysmorphic disorder, the age of digital beauty, the effects of cultural preference and peer pressures on women as it relates to their bodies.

The documentary will end in what I call, the Reclamation. Here, all the elements of the documentary will come together like a crescendo in a symphony. Our characters will talk about their future in relation to their bodies, self-esteem, and their understanding of happiness.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:721:"The documentary will be told through the eyes of Lynda Okonkwo. Lynda has a smile that can light up any room and it doesn’t take much to get a tear to drop from her eyes, perhaps that’s what makes her a terrific actor. She is a 120kg, 6ft, fair-skinned goddess, someone the film industry considers “too fat to fit into some roles”. 
For one in the spotlight, her body is constantly on display and opportunities to shine often evade her, and the little that fall on her laps are ladled with stereotype and body shaming. 
Underneath the wide smile and bubbling personality, is a girl who wishes people can see past the number on the scale and accept her for who she is; a brilliant actor with a beautiful smile.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1912:"The desired tone and visual representation of the subject matter are going to be tailored to resonate with and be reflective of the primary target audience; women. The story is character-driven and the subject matter will be explored through the life of our primary character. Interviews from learned fellows on different aspects of the subject matter will also feed into the narrative.

Each interview will be framed in a way that the locations become characters in the story. The locations will play an integral part in strengthening the narrative flow.
Beauty lighting will form the basis of the lighting design of this documentary. The lighting will tell a story; one of freedom and acceptance. The lighting will be flattery and complementary, concealing nothing. However, if a character being interviewed insists on anonymity, we will explore the use of silhouette and light shaping to keep the character hidden. We will go a step further in distorting the voice, not to a level where it will be inaudible but comfortable for the character to express herself.

The sound accompanying the story being told will be in layers. The documentary will open with a poem, glorifying the female body and the struggles it has endured over time. This poem will be accompanied by compelling images to lure the audience into the world they are about to experience. The emotional beats of the story will be accompanied by melancholy music to reel the audience in. Other explorative parts of the documentary will be complemented by soulful, alternative RnB.

The documentary will be made up of interviews, re-enactments, archival videos, and pictures much for the visual appeal of the audience. Because of the unavailability of certain footage, there will be a re-enactment of scenes by professional actors. The actor’s performance, however, will be as realistic as possible, in line with the flow of the story.

This version of the story is told from the point of view of the colonizer.
The space for the struggle for the liberation of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde occurred in the forests and savannas of Guinea Bissau. According to the people's aspiration, Amílcar Cabral, leader of the armed struggle and of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde - PAIGC- and ideologue of the independence of the two countries, considers extending the armed struggle to the islands of Cape Verde.
To this end, it begins to mobilize Cape Verdeans scattered throughout the diaspora and forms a group of 31 young people, mostly students, including Pedro Pires, Júlio de Carvalho, Maria Ilidia, and Agnelo Dantas, who decide to embark on an adventure in order to participate in the armed liberation struggle in Cape Verde.
These young people are then sent to Cuba, where they live in complete hiding, and for two years on the island, 1965/67 are subjected to intense military training, with hard hours of guerrilla and artillery training.
With the murder of Che Guevara, the strategy changed and the group ended up not landing in Cape Verde. But, they realized that they could contribute to the liberation of Cape Verde, participating actively in the struggle in Guinea Bissau. Later on, these selfless Creole guerrillas formed the Cape Verdean nation and became influential figures in the country's political life.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1694:"Today, Pedro Pires is the president of Instituto Pedro Pires, an important institution in Cape Verde that promotes leadership training. He was the leader of the Cuba group and even became President of Cape Verde. He is a charismatic figure and considered a historical commander of the national liberation struggle.
Commander Júlio de Carvalho is nowadays a businessman in the trade. He was former Minister of Defense, in the early years of independence he lived in Guinea Bissau and was very dear to the Guinean population and Cubans. At the time of the mobilization, he was studying Chemical Engineering, in Coimbra. He fled Portugal because he had heard that Amílcar Cabral was going to be in Paris. 
Commander Agnelo Dantas, lives the peaceful life of a retired state military officer. He was the youngest of the group, part of Cape Verde at the age of 17, full of revolutionary ideas and to avoid Portuguese military service. His dream was to fight to expel the colonizer from his beloved homeland. After the fight, he was the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Cape Verde.
Maria Ilidia, currently lives in Portugal. She was the only woman in the group. Early on, she begins to realize the differences created by colonialism. It was in the middle of World War II and troops were stationed on the island where she lived, but the Portuguese soldiers and the Cape Verdean soldiers were separated, even the food was different. At the same time she sees her father being beaten and imprisoned, she grows up to fear who had white skin.
In “Nós, Povo das Ilhas” what we are going to do is to enter the intricacies of this bold and daring operation, but little known and publicized.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1979:"How to tell an episode of a country's official history? How to film emblematic and influential figures from Cape Verde, detaching us from the repeated journalistic narratives that build a cold heroic discourse?
We decided to embark on the adventure of telling this episode, using two central elements: the interviews and the archive. When making the teaser we realized that our characters are people very used to the formal interview; and for that reason, when analyzing this material later, we decided that the interviews of the film would be made from a more intimate look. 
We want to interview these characters in their homes, or on the symbolic stages of the war and the early years of independence (today empty spaces and many of them abandoned). Taking these characters to their center, it is a way to return to the core of emotional and emotional memory. We believe that we will reach these non-places of memory, where the characters can question themselves and make themselves known in another way.
To guide this narrative within more personal and intimate space, director Elson Santos will be the narrator that will introduce the “voice” of Cape Verdean youth, who inquires about their past. 
This questioning from a personal perspective will lead the viewer to follow Elson, not only during the interviews with the characters but also in the relentless search for archival material to support this story.
The archival material, which is found only outside Cape Verde (in Portugal, France, and Cuba). The fact that it is so difficult to access the historical memory of a country, is a problem common to all African youth, it will then be an issue that will accompany this archive research. This essayistic and reflective tone will accompany the entire film, as a way of deconstructing the heroic propaganda narratives.
We intend to invite the viewer to question deeply about the value of memory while getting to know the intimate side of all these characters.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:0:"";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:0:"";s:14:"representation";s:0:"";s:21:"representation_upload";s:21:"2021/1618207835_1.jpg";s:16:"contracts_upload";s:0:"";s:15:"artistic_upload";s:0:"";s:13:"visual_upload";s:0:"";s:12:"project_link";s:0:"";s:16:"project_password";s:0:"";s:8:"synopsis";s:0:"";s:13:"projectBudget";s:6:"178615";s:13:"financialPlan";s:0:"";s:12:"totalSecured";s:5:"45405";s:12:"totalApplied";s:1:"0";s:11:"totalPening";s:1:"0";s:13:"BudgetDeficit";s:6:"133210";s:10:"budgetFile";s:21:"2021/1618208905_1.pdf";s:9:"proofFile";s:0:"";s:13:"contractProof";s:0:"";s:12:"ackStatement";s:0:"";s:11:"submittedBy";s:10:"Lara Sousa";s:12:"project_role";s:8:"producer";s:10:"filmmanker";s:0:"";s:8:"producer";s:0:"";s:20:"project_co_ordinator";s:0:"";s:13:"project_role2";s:0:"";s:16:"project_category";s:0:"";s:13:"project_brief";s:0:"";s:16:"project_timeline";s:1:"0";s:16:"project_describe";s:0:"";s:12:"organisation";s:0:"";s:20:"explain_organisation";s:0:"";s:15:"briefly_explain";s:0:"";s:14:"socio_economic";s:0:"";s:10:"video_link";s:0:"";s:16:"description_link";s:0:"";s:20:"description_password";s:0:"";s:15:"proposal_upload";s:0:"";s:10:"project_co";s:1:"0";s:8:"complete";s:1:"1";s:6:"status";s:1:"2";s:5:"addon";s:19:"2021-07-02 20:11:43";s:5:"award";s:1:"0";}i:17;a:54:{s:2:"id";s:3:"127";s:8:"grant_id";s:2:"18";s:7:"user_id";s:3:"126";s:4:"name";s:24:"Le spectre de boko haram";s:6:"p_date";s:2:"70";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:8:"e_length";s:3:"60+";s:7:"logline";s:172:"

Visually, the film navigates between mystical and surrealistic night scenes, punctuated by the appalling tales of children and the banality of their busy daily life. We plan to explore magical realism in this documentary to enhance our artistic creation.
Magical realism is an artistic current which "intends to offer a vision of reality renewed and broadened by taking into consideration the part of the strangeness, irrationality or mystery that it conceals. The story and the characters are anchored in reality, but the author introduces a magical or fantastic element that is not questioned in the fiction  ". Magical realism has inspired directors like Akira Kurosawa (dreams) Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie from Montmartre) or Benh Zeitlin (The beasts of the sourthern wild). We didn’t find so much references in documentary, but I guess if only we push forward the research, we might be able to find some.So, when asked how to transpose these elements of magical realism to this documentary project, we thought about observing nature and using different elements, namely air, water or even earth. Our reference in the matter would be the films by Andrei Tarkovsky the mirror and the Stalker. Films through which these elements play an important role, bringing a touch that is simultaneously surreal, magical, hypnotic and enigmatic. In this project, we intend to add to these elements, a discourse and a poetic capture of images through long static takes.
Thus,the rhythm will sometimes be frenzied to emphasize the dynamism of children always in perpetual motion, sometimes posed, poetic and contemplative to represent the environment in which they live, a frozen space-time. In Kolofata, the barrier between the past, the present and the future becomes very porous. The village looks like so many other Cameroonian villages to those which already existed 50 years; 100 years ago.

An unforgiving sun, a parched earth, a high mortality rate among youngsters and a failed economy have left the village desolate. A place where women are rarely allowed to have an active role in public. A place known for sectarian turbulence between Copts and Muslims, in which Copts are killed and driven out of their homes for their faith, among attacks on churches. Disenfranchised Coptic girls rebel by forming an all-female street theater troupe. MONIKA, a girl with a jaundiced tomboyish voice dreams to be a famous singer. MAGDA, the young leader of the group dreams to study theater and be a theater director, in a place that lacks even the primary education. MARINA, a clueless girl suffers domestic violence and epileptic seizures. MERIEM, alongside her seven girls’ siblings, carries the shame of not having a brother in the family. HEIDI, dreams to be a ballet dancer but what does that mean to her illiterate parents? The girls resist the classical roles they are destined for. They role-play as women, boys, men and trees. They are at that age where they can be anything they imagine to be. Their chemistry, their camaraderie and their bond seduce us into a world of their own. They sing, dance and run around performing in the allies, chanting folk songs, contemplating their future and criticizing how their conservative culture dictates their behavior. Their actions confuse their families, challenging the villagers, priests and the camera. Their unawareness of their own limitations pushes the boundaries of theatre and film.
All of them are confronted by prejudice and a deeply misogynistic climate. Their activities come with a lot of risk-taking. The conservative priests ask the Coptic people not to participate or attend the girls’ performance. They are not that welcomed in the churches. They are harassed when performing in the allies with Muslim majority.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1933:"MONIKA
18-year-old MONICA, with a grand tattoo of the Virgin Mary on her right arm, stands out from the group with her tomboyish attitude and masculine voice. What makes it even harder is the misunderstanding she often encounters, the people who insult her, mock her voice and instantly judge him. Villagers call her (a dude) and (a freak) and she was subjected to bullying and mockery for years. Many ask her to make an operation to remedy her coarse voice. However, she loves to sing. She creates her own self-defense mechanism. A mixture of showing off, lying to herself, and lying to others.
MAGDA
21-year-old MAGDA is the troupe’s young leader with an aura of wisdom, a face full of acne, stubborn eyes and a charming smile. Magda’s conflict is her seeking of validation from her older and younger brothers. Magda’s dream is to study theater in the Theater Institute in Cairo.
MARINA
A 24-year-old MARINA holds sacred beliefs yet at the same time is needled by doubts and fears that she is unable to articulate. She does not trust herself. She does not see a future for herself. Her brother beats her regularly. She is observed at all times by everyone. She describes her condition as moving with chains around her feet. The weight of which, slows her down and wounds her.
MYRIAM
Myriam carries the shame of her family and her parents, having only a female progeny. It is a family of seven daughters. Girls mean a worse livelihood. Villagers prefer to have boys because they can depend on them in work and carrying on the family name and business.
HAIDI
HAIDY, is the troupe’s slender 17-year-old writer. She joins the troupe in spite of the reservation of her family and relatives, especially her priest uncle. Haidy practices theater every day. She dreams of becoming a ballet dancer and leaving her small village behind. She is playful and she has many secret love affairs through Facebook and social media. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2000:"We aim to enter the bubble of these girls’ world, chasing the wildness and elusiveness of being young. Their lightheartedness contrasts starkly with the harsh reality of the future they are making plans for. In this coming-of-age story, we focus on those girls, who emanate strength, resilience, intelligence, courage, and love for each other. A hybrid of documentary aesthetic and unscripted narrative, depicting real people in an insular rural community, in which nonprofessional actors play versions of their real-life selves. That will allow us to explore the border between tragedy and freedom, control and submission, true and false, limitation and power of cinema. An interpenetration of fiction into reality and of reality into fiction. The camera holds in the edges of its frame the fear and restrictions those girls refuse to acknowledge. It interacts with the girls self-images and stories, allowing their journey, both visually and narratively, to play with the audience own perception.
We develop those characters through intimate close-ups that portray their internal struggles, self-deception, and pressure of their future, confusion and conflict of faith.
This story packed with personal drama follows the girls as they go about their turbulent daily lives, leaving plenty of space for livestreams, telephone conversations, intimate video diaries where they show what’s going on in their lives, from their own perspective, and share their thoughts about it. The sectarian violence events are also told through the mobile phone videos and livestreams.
That reality is intertwined with the girls’ dreams, stories and myths. That reveals not only their psychological state but also have a route in universal “spiritual traditions” in myths and religion. For instance, the girls walking on water, which has a resonance in Christianity and in Ancient Egyptian religion. Another example is Myriam, who always dreams of flying.

In the Northern part of Kenya, pastoralists are suffering. Their goats and cows have been dying 
in hordes whenever drought strikes provoking them to change tact and shift to keeping camels.
Pastoralists communities are now putting more emphasis on camel rearing or shifting from 
other livestock species to camels (A climate change resilience strategy) which are more drought 
resistant for milk and meat production. 
Unlike cows and goats, camels can go for up to two weeks without water and still have constant 
milk production.

they used to sell before. Working with cooperatives enables women to spend more time with

number only around 4,000. And only less than 5 people, all over the age of 70, can speak the ethnic group’s native language, Yakunte, fluently.

The Yaaku are believed to have migrated from Ethiopia to Kenya, where they settled in the Mukogodo forest, west of Mount Kenya, more than 100 years ago. They interacted with rendile and formed a tribe known as the Yaaku. The Yaaku, whose name means “hunting people,” kept bees and began trading with the Maasai, the country’s largest pastoral people. Eventually the Yaaku assimilated into Masai culture, adopting the Masai tongue over their own Cushitic language.

As the number of Yakunte speakers has dwindled, various efforts have been made to save the language. Yakunte speakers and a Dutch researcher wrote a Yakunte dictionary in 2004. Advocates of the people established the Yaaku People Association in 2003, dedicated to preserving its culture. Recently, according to a BBC report, a local school funded by the French Cultural Group is holding language classes twice a month for young Yaaku.

I have been part of this effort to preserve this language by featuring their culture and traditions  on a TV show that I produced called Foods Of Kenya. This however is not enough since it's only a feature.

I would love to produce a 60 min documentary, detailing this tribe's  livelihood, culture, songs  and tribe before it all gets extinct with the older generation. I believe that documenting this tribe in video will have more impact than even writing a dictionary with the languages,

The story structure will be following the life of a Yakunte speaking old man as he teaches children the tribe through, songs and dance, cultural beliefs, tradition and way of life.

";s:22:"characters_description";s:699:"Our Main Characters will be:
1. The 3 Yakunte Speaking older generation. They appear through out the documentary wearing their traditional outfits and walking with a stick. they posses alot of knowledge about their culture but cannot share this with the younger generations due to language barrier even though they are from the same community.

2. 5 Yaaku children (boys and girls) who don't speak the language. appears at the start of the documentary with a modern look to emphasise on the lack of relation between them and the older generation. their look changes as the documentary progresses since they have started to learn the Yakunte tribe and are able to hold conversations in the tribe

The plan is to use the series as a tool to assist people at different levels of society to grapple with the big threat that the climate emergency presents to humanity, bio-diversity and sustainability of life as we know it in Southern Africa. 
 
Intertwining the stories of people who are living at the forefront of the changing climate in Southern Africa, we show how it is those least responsible for this crisis that are most adversely impacted. And in a region where every degree of warming will make a vast difference to how well future generations fare, the series tracks the journey of individuals and movements striving to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. Yet in this region, where the mineral energy complex has shaped the economy, as Naomi Klein would say, ‘This changes everything’.
 
While we draw on the knowledge of African climate scientists to break down the causes of the crisis, the thrust of the series is the eight unique but interwoven, character led storylines, taking place in Namibia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and South Africa. Concluding a year of research and development in communities where the combined effects of climate and social crisis are rapidly reshaping daily life, in each case the POV will be that of people leading the charge for a sustainable future. In this, we offer the gift of the collective wisdom of activists, youth and women’s leadership, and indigenous knowledge systems. While we focus on the most important climate justice priorities in Southern Africa at the moment – drought, food security, a just transition from fossil fuels, and making safe the air we breathe  - the central thread of HotSpot is questioning how we got here and how we navigate our way into a future where we live, consume and produce in a way that supports and regenerates the natural world that we depend on for survival.

Mozambique: Celia Macamo is an academic whose mission is to help restore the Mozambique coastline. Jacinta Laissone’s responsibility is to implement a new Climate Action Plan for the city of Xai Xai. Can these two mothers persuade enough people to get behind this life saving work? 
 
Zimbabwe: Admire Gwatidzo, a permaculture farmer and community coordinator grows food in abundance for over 15 years in food insecure and drought stricken Zimbabwe. Can he replicate his methods? 
 
Namibia: Ina-Maria Shikongo, a young mother of three, spearheads an international campaign against oil drilling in the delta. 
 
South Africa: From Soweto, to the courtroom to Parliament, Francina Nkosi, a mother of four living next to Medupi coal power plant, Alex Lenferna, the brainchild of the Green New Eskom campaign, and Promise Mbilo, an eco-feminist, enviro champion and a key applicant in a deadly air court case against the South African government, build a Just Transition movement from the bottom up. 
 
Kolisa Sinyana is a vivacious young oceanographer, whose self-confessed passion is communicating the science of climate change to ordinary people. But what does this mean for a young black woman in South Africa, one who has fought poverty and patriarchy to make her mark as a marine scientist, as she projects into a future that is less than certain?
 
LGBTIQ+ youth activists Raeesa Mohammed and Gabriel Klaasen are in different ends of the country, finding relief in climate activism. When they meet a unique friendship is born out of shared hopes and fears. There is an urgency in their  POV that is compelling both to young black audiences, and to older viewers who cannot help but feel complicit in creating the problems that the young will inherit.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2009:"Using a format of six TV-hour episodes, the series follows eight storylines each led by a set of connected characters from across Southern Africa, that have a specific motivation and something to achieve. Each of the storylines centre around a physical place – a town, a forest, a borehole, a mine – or a cause or right that people are defending or fighting for. Audiences must care about these characters, and empathise strongly with their mission, their survival, or success or failure in what they set out to do.

Style - Our interviews with the characters will be in situ, often outside or in the spaces the protagonists inhabit or work in. The style of filming will allow for intimate moments with the characters, in their home and personal life, using verité hand-held style of filmmaking. 

It is important that through the main storylines, clear information about the climate science is presented, and why urgent and dramatic shifts need to happen across the region.  The interwoven stories draw strongly on nature-based solutions, local knowledge and ideas, and eco-feminist thinking which helps shift our connection to the environment. We want people to understand that our natural environment is not just a resource to exploit, but to realise that the environment is us. How can we support that idea? 

Shots of nature - life giving forests, rivers, estuaries, wilderness, freshwater as a celebration, earth and soil that hold our food; and the power of nature to break, erode and cause devastation help us connect to the natural world. Each storyline holds a trace of the living world and that thread needs to be tangible in the visuals. 

Visual motifs – For each storyline, a parallel recurring visual motif mirrors this development over time. A natural element – be it a polluted river, a plot of farmed land, a section of coastline – is filmed over the production period presenting the growth, the decay, the loss, the filling up or emptying of that piece of environment.

For close to thirty years, asylum seekers from over fifteen countries in and beyond east Africa have called Kakuma their home. It is here that they have formed new communities, grown businesses, married, raised children and buried friends and family.

In our documentary Repatriation, we will follow Kenyan born and raised South Sudanese ‘refugee’ David Erjok. Unverified as a Kenyan citizen Erjok carries both Kenya and South Sudan heavy in his heart and like many, remains unsure what will his future holds.

The story picks up from Nairobi where Erjok currently undertakes his undergraduate studies at the Pan Africa Christian University. Just as he was growing accustomed to life in Nairobi, the coronavirus pandemic hit, limiting interactions with friends and family.  

Lonely and anxious, Erjok is keen to get back to Kakuma during the August break where he will discuss with his family their options, if at all.

Through this short but impactful cinematic film, Erjok will reveal the slow and painful erosion of asylum seeker’s rights worldwide.

Using Erjok’s poetry the film will conjure imagery of the countless lives of migrants lost at sea, children in detention centers, the growing demolitions in the West bank rendering many homeless, all the while questioning the right to a safe home.

Repatriation is a short documentary that will follow two key narrative threads: firstly, Erjok’s desire and journey for integration. 

Transporting the viewer from Nairobi to Kakuma, the second thread comes as a mix of beautiful stories from the host community, civil workers, expatriates and more whose lives will be affected by the closure of the camps. Through a number of micro-narratives, we will hear their idea of home and why integration is difficult.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:638:"David Erjok is a poet, rapper and refugee activist.

I know this movie must be a hit considering how well Director Chuks handles his project. Glad to be part. 

Wasn’t sure of where the story was headed at first but the endpoint is wow. In love with my character (kayode).

I know how detailed Mercy (producer) can be when picking a script so I never expected anything less.

Good story but I might have preferred the character lami to have been a boy.

We can’t wait for this project, love the plotting.

Excellent use of English language and of course the promotion of the northern dialect is fantastic and I love the degree of suspense.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:2017:"More than nine years after the protests began, Syria has known one of the largest exodus of its modern history, especially towards Lebanon, a country itself under high tension and sharing a particular history with neighboring Syria. 

Now, Syrians constitute one of the largest displaced populations in modern history (8 millions people inside the country and 5 millions outside). Despite having opened its borders Lebanon’s policy towards them has hardened since 2015, making renewals for temporary residence permits almost impossible. 

For instance, Lebanon does not recognize the “right of the soil”. Syrians living in Lebanon, in most cases for long years, are in a difficult situation: most of them are illegal residents, dozens of thousands of new- born children on Lebanese soil are stateless and if a Syrian dies in Lebanon, his/her body is often not accepted in cemeteries. What I essentially want is to capture the desires, goals, and dreams, the relentless humanity of those people enduring an inhumane situation, unwanted wherever they go.

For about a year and a half, I started conducting remote research from by home country of Tunisia, to draw out the first basis of the project. The film received development support from the IDFA Bertha Fund, the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture and the Beirut Film Station (Goethe Institute Lebanon), which allowed me to make several trips to Lebanon and feed my research. 

That’s how I met Fadia, Leena, and Abou Ala who started telling me about their lives. Thanks to these encounters, I was able to conceive a first narrative framework for my project and a provisional structure.

The film will be composed of these portraits at different moments of life, and put together, they will create a storyline which will go from pregnancy to exile and emancipation.

The three of them have fled war-torn Syria and found refuge in Lebanon. Through their portraits emerge the fractures and paradoxes of a region under high tension as each one of them is struggling to achieve a goal and realize a dream in a hostile exile.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1640:"The film is to be shot mostly in Beirut, but also in the coastal cities of Tyr (south of the country) and Tripoli (in the north) in order to properly cover the nationwide humanitarian tragedy that is happening there. Lebanon has become the equivalent of an open-air camp now that the number of Syrians refugees on its soil is almost reaching 1.5 million people. Scattered across the country these men an women live in “informal settlements” and “collective shelters” but also in disused and abandoned buildings, in huts in the middle of fields or in garages and deposits.

Regarding my filmmaking approach, I intend to do most of the shots with handheld camera. The different portraits will also be part of a larger mosaic of people and families living in different situations and different locations in Lebanon. During editing, long shots will punctuate the film, as a way of reporting on their marginal status. Shots that will cross the line of conventional editing, as if to retain as many gestures, sensations and emotions as possible.

How can one be filming when he/she is at the heart of one of the most important events in terms of international issues?
This represents to me a visceral question, since my body is being involved in the process as a filming and testifying tool. This singular situation calls for a cinematographic reflection and invention. My documentary will not be informative nor didactic, but rather intimate, close to the people I will film. It will pay attention to what surrounds them - Lebanon as a territory and as a society. It focuses on deconstructing rather than constructing a discourse.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:2016:"Umra Omar was raised in Lamu by her grandmother before studying and working in the US as a psychologist. She returned home in 2014 just as Lamu was attacked by Al Shabab fighters, leaving dispensaries & schools in the area deserted. That’s when Umra founded Safari Doctors to provide medical services to the communities cut-off by the conflict. 

After 6 years growing the organization beyond expectations, the Lamu streets are overflowing with trash while the state-run medical facilities have deteriorated further, often empty of personnel, medical supplies & even running water. Umra’s frustration with a corrupt local government has finally reached breaking point, and her decision to run for Governor (the highest seat of power) in the upcoming elections is already disrupting the male-dominated political order, who’ve never had to contend with a female candidate so vocal about their failing leadership.  

Situated on Kenya’s northern coastal border, Lamu is famous for its exquisite Swahili architecture, 14th Century old town & untouched tropical islands. Isolated & neglected since independence, Lamu is the third poorest county in Kenya. But change is imminent with a $25B infrastructure project featuring a China-funded mega-port, industrial city, coal power plant and oil pipeline. This has triggered a scramble for land by outside businessmen, as tensions rise with the locals whose fisheries and mangrove forests are being destroyed, along with a growing Kenyan and US military presence trying to gain control over lawless southern Somalia.

It is amongst this geo-political quagmire that 37-year-old Umra is transitioning from humanitarian hero to a bare-knuckled political organizer. With no political experience or corporate backing, amidst a growing onslaught of misogynistic vitriol, this film is a close-and-intimate chronicle of Umra’s decision to dance with the devil, revealing the huge personal costs to her and her family as she enters the scrappy arena of Kenyan politics.";s:22:"characters_description";s:2022:"Umra Omar, the eldest of 3 sisters, grew up barefoot in the remote Pate Island village of Tchundwa, raised by her grandmother, a matriarch who had 8 husbands and 18 children.  Reunited with her parents in Nairobi after they finished their studies, Umra was awarded a high-school scholarship at Atlantic College in Wales before studying neuroscience & psychology at Oberlin College in USA. After her first placements in Washington DC and New York City, she returned to Kenya in 2014 for a job with Open Society Foundation, before the Al Shabaab attacks in Lamu compelled her to start Safari Doctors.

Umra’s father, Omar Bwana is an anomaly amongst Swahili men for educating his three daughters at an ivy-league level. As a young man, his work in preserving Swahili culture impressed the paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey, and together they founded Lamu Museum, excavating the many ancient Swahili ruins dotted around the archipelago. Omar was a prolific political organiser in the 1950’s, forming the Shungwaya Party to begin agitating for Kenya’s independence. In 1972 he was selected by President Moi as a nominated Member of Parliament before becoming chairman of National Museums of Kenya. Umra’s biggest cheerleader, he has been quietly pulling strings behind the scenes & calling upon his political contacts to open their doors to his daughter.

Other characters in the film include Umra’s 2 children Azza & Bwana. Umra’s chief-of-staff Ismael Bwana & her campaign manager Sande Oyolo, who is closely aligned with William Ruto, the current Vice-President of Kenya, and favourite to win the presidency in 2022.

Umra’s mother and two sisters are also of interest. Since Umra’s announcement to run, they are asked for money everywhere they go, and the prices for a boat-taxi, motorbike or even a meal at a restaurant have now doubled. Already uncomfortable with this disruption to their lives, they are not yet agreeable to be in the film, but we hope this will change as the campaign progresses";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2019:"UMRA is an intimate and personal feature-length documentary following the life of a political candidate over 18 months leading to election day.  We will mix verite scenes & informal interviews filmed with deeply saturated colours and a sharp, cinematic visual approach in the style of an international noir spy-thriller, set amongst the enchanting fishing-village of Lamu.

Iconic for it’s fusion of cultures over thousands of years of Indian Ocean trade between Africa, Arabia, Europe, India and China, Lamu’s coral fortresses hold ancient secrets that pass with the wispy perfume of fully-veiled women in black buibuis. Donkeys bray throughout the day as traders dust away sand from their stalls of tropical fruit & spices. The Imam’s 5 daily calls to prayer resonate through the narrow cobbled streets & an influx of men in white kanzus enter and exit the many mosques for their time with Allah, a refreshing purity amongst the otherwise stifling heat.

The relaxed observational scenes of Umra and her family at home will contrast the intense pressure and chaos of the political campaign & rallies. We will play visually with a dual consciousness which Umra describes as a mental separation of her real life self (known only to her friends and family) from her public ‘poster’ persona (alone and isolated, where people demand everything from her like a walking ATM).  We also want to visually explore Umra’s background in neuro-science, psychology and public-health, and her love of chess, to articulate a deeply cerebral awareness of human nature, and how that translates into her political strategy.

Musically the film will feature an original score co-composed by director Maia (a prolific Kenyan musician) together with local swahili musicians who carry the richness of Taarab music, fusing middle-eastern scales with stringed orchestras and deep african drum syncopation.  The score will also be electronic, gritty and industrial at times, to build and release the story’s tension & drama.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:132:"Filming has continued in May and June, several more foundational scenes have been captured.  Currently concentrating of fundraising.";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:2008:"UMRA is a story that needs to be told now, and needs to be told well - with a passion and tenacity that mirrors the protagonist. Our first 2 features (The Letter, 2019 and How to Build a Library, in production) also feature unbelievably strong women who spoke to us so deeply that we kept at it for years because these are the stories the world needs to see.

Our third feature, UMRA is our most ambitious and risky project yet: with a short time-frame, in a location where logistics are expensive, security is volatile, and a protagonist who is ruffling some very powerful feathers. Since November 2020, we’ve travelled to Lamu 3 times and managed to film and cut a fundraising trailer without any financial support, while simultaneously releasing and producing our first 2 films.

Having captured several key scenes of the foundational stages of the campaign, our primary goal has been to form a deep relationship with Umra built on trust, honesty and mutual respect.  Having known Umra and her sisters since 2015, we were able to jump straight into filming with her and her kids, staying at her place to immerse ourselves into her life and enjoy many long conversations into the night to understand each other better and discuss the overwhelming need for a political revolution in Kenya. This is the foundation on which the next 18 months of filming rests, together with our cultural awareness, speaking the language and our own Swahili-roots (Maia’s father’s family lineage connects back to Lamu sultan in the 1800’s, Umra’s father even has a book about the life of Maia’s Great-Grandfather).

Lamu is a heavily walled city, insular and encrypted to most outsiders.  Umra and her family are unique in their openness to a film crew, and between the strength of our relationship, her love of the camera and a strong pride to showcase her culture and homeland, this film will provide an insight into swahili culture, family-life and local Kenyan politics that few films have ever achieved.";s:14:"representation";s:1943:"As we see time & again, Kenyan superheroes like Umra are ultimately powerless in a broken system, and the film will highlight the immense price paid by those who try to change it. A strong dramatic engine is inherent in Umra’s mission, along with a clear ending. The 2 main narrative challenges we anticipate are (1) accessing her political opponents, and (2) capturing the protagonist’s more ruthless side which may contradict her clean public image. By employing a good local fixer we can overcome the 1st & the 2nd will be solved by remaining independent, which Umra understands is a vital ingredient to making the story realistic & compelling. Umra cannot survive the journey unscathed, and she is open & honest about us filming the risks & moral compromises she must make to win.

So far we’ve shot everything ourselves (Maia: sound / Chris: camera). On our 3rd, current trip in Lamu we’ve brought a DoP from Nairobi to build familiarity with the subjects, as we prepare to give birth to our first child in August 2021. A grant from DOCA would allow us to ensure the DoP & fixer can continue capturing the unfolding events from July to October. We then intend to rent a house in Lamu long-term & make a second base to continue filming the campaign through to August 2022. 

The film will be shot in 4K with cine prime lenses to achieve a cinematic vitality.  We’ve been inspired by films like “Knock Down The House”, “War Room” as well as Samaher Alqadi’s feminist inditement of the arab spring “As I Want”, and Sam Soko’s “Softie” which lay bare the flawed Kenyan political process.  We want to push the documentary genre by emulating the framing, suspenseful editing, music and aerial cinematography from film-noirs like “Chinatown” and spy-thrillers such as “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” & “Bourne Identity'' which we feel can help elevate the film’s aesthetic and commercial appeal.

Our story will focus on Shiku a mother who does everything to keep her child off the streets and Donga, a child who was kicked out by the mother to be raised by the streets.

Our first character is Nairobi. She symbolizes a place with the highest form of financial redemption but when you scratch deeper, the risks attached to succeeding in the city become clear. She nurtures, shelters and feeds millions daily, the difference is how she interacts with her children.

Shiku is a mother of two and a low end sex worker who lost one of her sons through extrajudicial execution and who currently tries to transition to becoming an upstanding member of society.

Donga, once a violent criminal on the police’s most wanted list, now wears many hats; tour guide, taxi driver. He is actively pursuing music and seeks to offer a better foundation to his son by being a positive male role model.

Donga and Shiku have known nothing but bare minimums. To the backdrop of excess, they have received nominal guidance, childhood, education, love, shelter, you name it. Circumstances that have informed their past and present pursuits. Having lost a great deal along the way, the hunger to move from reduced qualities of life keeps them searching for better times.

Our characters are making changes to their lives from their regrettable pasts to hopeful futures, with their children as catalysts.

We follow them as they modify their lifestyles to assimilate to their quests for legitimacy. Previewing what it takes to be reinstituted into the same society that had denied them access to resources and skills from the very beginning, as well as showing their efforts to provide what they lacked to their offspring.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:1256:"Shiku - 
One of many sex workers who patrol the dimly lit Nairobi night streets. Midway through her pursuit, she received damning news about her eldest son; a 19-year-old boy who was shot twelve times by a notorious killer cop in Eastleigh, Nairobi. Now left in limbo, and with the advent of Coronavirus restrictions, she does ‘regular’ jobs while searching for closure from her loss to keep her second born son, Imran, off the streets and avoid him suffering the same fate.

Donga
Boisterous and driven, a proud father, budding and talented musician. Donga’s life has been shaped by bullets and blood. From the age of 8, Donga was raised by the streets that left him with no option but to beg, steal and eventually become one of Nairobi's wanted criminals.
 
To earn a living in hopes of funding his musical pursuits, he guides paying tourists through the city he previously tormented as a gang member; showing them a haunting previous life he is trying to separate himself from. Between surviving in a cut-throat town by yearning to opt out of the street life and the frustrations of booking studio space with nothing more than the promises of passion, what remains essential to him is the need to present a better father figure to his son.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1567:"We want to portray our city and its inhabitants oscillating between beauty and realism, capturing the beauty of situations and the fragility of the people.

Whenever our protagonists interact with their children, they reveal a calmness. The camera reflects this in still imagery of planned compositions. The anxieties and movements are of human causes and experiences, something we show through a handheld camera when we are on the streets. This accentuates the grit and realism of Nairobi's fast pace. The lens will expose the raw developments of the characters as they unfold from the comforts of their personal spaces to the rat race society with minimal staging.

The film will use a mix of cinema verite, direct cinema and interviews to paint pictures of Shiku and Donga’s experiences of living and parenting in Nairobi. Every scene and image presented will be handled delicately and with a lot of dignity. The motion picture will oscillate between the past using symbolic poetry showcasing the lives of Donga and Shiku’s first born son, and the present, depicted by beautiful imagery of their current state. 

The audio will consist of ambient recordings of the environments, city and surroundings from footage captured and from the narratives of interviews conducted from the subjects.
The main voices and focus of the picture will be Shiku and Donga who will weave us in and out of their daily life proceedings, introducing us to characters who advance subplots relating to or complementing their journey to breaking free from the loop of hardship.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:156:"We recently completed the Follow The Nile development & mentorship program 2020/2021 which was followed by a successful pitch at DokFest Munich in May 2021.";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:577:"My society has an INCLINATION to sensationalize people living odd lives and odd jobs based on person perception. This film invites its viewers into the lives of Shiko and Donga with a frangible perception. It hopes to reverse the desensitizing narratives derived from fear, disgust and negative moral judgments like the ones I harboured before the journey to making this film.
The protagonists unapologetically characterize a rare mental fortitude to be who they are. Their lives invoke subliminal conversations like childcare, morality, mortality and love in today's society.";s:14:"representation";s:1687:"I feel that as human beings we all have a cycle that we are caught up in and want to break at one point in our lives. This is all in hopes of entering an easier loop that promises a better life than the one we are currently in. 

When I first heard Donga's story, I took a moment to reflect on my reaction when a street kid comes to my car window to beg when the traffic lights turn red. I mostly didn't even look to the side with the fear that I'd make eye contact which would intensify the begging. I never had a moment where I stopped to ask what their story was or to even accord them the respect of responding to their knock on my window. And this is all from the social stigma I've unconsciously carried towards street kid. 

Then, I met Shiku. The first footage I watched of her reached out to me because she spoke with honesty and vulnerability I would not have expected out of a sex worker. Again, because of the social stigma and negative narratives I've carried around prostitution, which never allowed me to view the humans behind these branding. Shiku was morning the death of her son and I could hear the undertones of self blame and doubt as she reflected on how she raised her son.

This film embraces some very bold themes and bears a universal outlook as it invokes universal conversations around parenting, love and mortality in today's society. 

Donga and Shiku's pursuits for a better life expose a larger societal issue of its over-dependence on broken systems that promise people redemption while consistently devaluing human lives.

Il se retrouve dans la rue, avec ses camarades du mouvement FRAPP pour lutter contre les inégalités et l’injustice. ";s:15:"story_structure";s:2065:"Le 2 juin 2019, la chaine britannique BBC diffuse une enquête de Mayeni Jones, intitulée : « Sénégal : Scandale à 10 milliards de dollars ». Dans ce reportage, la BBC affirme détenir les preuves qu’Aliou Sall, frère cadet du président de la République Macky Sall, a touché des pots-de-vin en 2012 pour l’attribution de deux concessions pétrolières à l’homme d’affaires Frank Timis. 
Ce reportage de la BBC déclenche un soulèvement populaire au Sénégal. Les jeunes sortent dans la rue et se mobilisent pour protester contre le gouvernement de Macky Sall car ils estiment intolérable que les dirigeants sénégalais et les multinationales s’enrichissent au détriment de la population. Parmi ces manifestants, il y a Abdoulaye Seck, 21 ans, étudiant en troisième année de Licence d’analyse et politiques économiques à l’Université Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD) de Dakar. 
Abdoulaye Seck est très engagé politiquement. Il est le président des étudiants du mouvement FRAPP, Front révolutionnaire anti-impérialiste populaire et panafricaine. Depuis les années 2000, les conditions de vie à l’université sont devenues de plus en plus précaires à cause de la mauvaise gestion étatique. Les étudiants dorment dans les couloirs sur des matelas. Il faut se réveiller à 5 heures du matin pour pouvoir se doucher à temps. Pour lutter contre cette vie dure à l’université, les étudiants se sont mobilisés pour mettre en place un mouvement citoyen, le FRAPP. Ce mouvement veut réveiller les consciences des populations et mobiliser autour de la lutte pour une justice sociale.  
C’est dans ce contexte que le pays bascule dans la révolte en mars 2021.Le sentiment d’injustice et les frustrations provoquées par la crise de la pandémie dégénèrent en violentes manifestations : il y a 10 morts et près de 600 blessés. L’enjeu du film repose sur la trajectoire d’Abdoulaye et son impact dans la réalité : Abdoulaye peut-il aller au bout de cette lutte ? Cette lutte peut-elle mener à une révolution ?";s:22:"characters_description";s:1295:"Abdoulaye Seck a 21 ans. Il est le fils d’un cheminot, syndicaliste et militant de gauche. Il a grandi dans une famille où la conscience anticoloniale est très forte. Il habite à Keur Massar, un quartier populaire de la banlieue dakaroise, où les conditions de vie sont catastrophiques. 
Il est en troisième année de Licence d’analyse et politiques économiques à l’université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar. Il est très engagé politiquement. Abdoulaye est au cœur de mon film. 
Si j’ai choisi Abdoulaye parmi tous ces jeunes, c’est sans doute en raison de son charisme et de sa sensibilité. A mes yeux, il incarne la jeunesse. Il se sent très concerné par l’avenir du Sénégal. A sa manière, il se bat pour son pays tous les jours. Malgré son jeune âge, il est déjà considéré comme un leader. 
Le fait de partager le point de vue d’Abdoulaye nous amène à réfléchir sur la situation du pays, la vie quotidienne de cette jeunesse : les difficultés, les rêves, les aspirations. En filmant Abdoulaye, je montre symboliquement le vécu quotidien de cette jeunesse.
Abdoulaye est le personnage auquel le spectateur s’identifie. Son engagement et sa détermination donnent au spectateur les éléments de sa propre réflexion sur la lutte de cette jeunesse. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2026:"En tant que cinéma du réel, République, Pétrole, Révolution puise ses fondements dans l’histoire du temps présent. C’est un film qui se construit sur la base d’un mouvement de contestation sociale d’ampleur inconnue depuis le mouvement « Y’en a marre » de 2012. Il s’agit donc pour moi de suivre le fil de l’histoire et de filmer l’évolution d’Abdoulaye et du mouvement dans une perspective qui se veut sensible. Je suis les évènements avec simplicité en accompagnant mes personnages et je les filme dans cette réalité qu’ils cherchent à faire évoluer. Cette logique me permet d’être authentique, d’être au plus proche des personnes et d’inscrire le projet dans l’actualité sur un temps long. Filmer Abdoulaye en mouvement, c’est filmer un possible avenir en construction.
L’espace du film est son territoire, ou ses territoires : la ville de Dakar, sa banlieue, parfois les régions. Si le récit est clairement ancré à Dakar grâce à Abdoulaye et au FRAPP, le film montre aussi à quel point le mouvement est implanté en banlieue et comment les principes du mouvement essaiment dans tout le pays à la faveur des luttes initiées aux côtés des communautés locales. Mais Dakar et sa banlieue restent au cœur du film, plus qu’un décor, presque un troisième personnage qui serait nécessaire à la concrétisation des rêves d’Abdoulaye et de ses camarades. 
Le processus de filmage va s’étaler sur un temps long de plusieurs mois. J’ai commencé à effectuer des repérages aux débuts du mouvement.

I am the camera. The one that evolves in my life and also a witness to events and manifestations taking place in and around me. I let the traditional objects speak as they take my place and talk about tradition. I am a camera trying to film what is hardly visible in an abstract poetic approach of imagery.
I have made a choice to stay in the dynamics of a unique focus, using a focale length of 24MM. My photographic intention is to conserve the same focal view through-out the film. I am followed by another camera that observes and questions these spirits in surroundings of the village. This last camera  serves as a means to prime myself in it’s frame and also a means to relieve myself from the autobiographic character of the piece. I’m proposing a sort of contemporary creative medium that blends with the spirits of the legends and tales of Africa .

";s:15:"story_structure";s:1909:"Three Rivers, Birim, Ayensu and Densu have their sources from the Atewa Forest, a giant water tower in Ghana. These rivers provide drinking water for over 5 million Ghanaians. The Birim joins the Pra River which enters the sea at Shama in the West. Densu joins the sea in the Greater Accra flowing some 240 kilometers from its source. Ayensu joins the sea at Winneba Wetlands area flowing some 116 kilometers. This water tower is under siege as the government is bent on mining bauxite in the forest. 

Ghana has a huge deposit of bauxite discovered in three locations namely, Awaso – which has been under severe mining in the past 76 years, Nyanahin – which has been given out last year to be mined and the popular Atewa Forest – which has been used as an exchange for 2 billion dollars from the Chinese Synohydro Company. The Atewa Forest has been earmarked for a National Park where experts say its ecological benefits over a longer period far outweighs the benefits of mining bauxite in the forest. The forest is Ghana’s remaining closed forest covering a total of 263 square kilometers.
 
In 2017 the Government of Ghana exchanged the forest for a 2 billion Chinese facility which has seen fierce resistance from NGOs, Community folks and CSOs. In 2019 the Chinese miners have created access routes in the Atewa forest. 

This story investigates how bauxite mining will destroy the fine ecosystem and contaminate the source of drinking water for over 6 million Ghanaians. It will also investigate as a prelude to the main documentary the projects that are supposed to be done under the arrangement and how far they have come up. It will require travelling to all the project sites and seeing at first-hand what they look like. The investigations will also extend to how community folks in Awaso bauxite mining community live in poverty and have seen no development for the past 77 years.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:1999:"Today the African woman is facing a decision that ultimately decides her fate as a girl-child, woman, mother, and wife. Her relevance today and in the future depends on understanding who she was, who she is now, and how she creates a lasting legacy for the next generation. 

For centuries, the African woman's history is not accessible as that of the western woman. Even in documentaries, the history of the African woman barely gets a mention. We call to mind the groundbreaking documentary, The Ascent of Women by Amanda Foreman. Yes, many African women were not very pleased that Africa women got minimal coverage. That is an indication that the African woman's story is for Africans to tell. 

This film decolonizes history and situates it in a social-cultural context. It studies how ancient African women withstood and fought against slavery and European influence for decades. How did they survive? How did they run a viable economic society while raising a family? It brings to the fore what the contemporary African woman needs to know about her heritage, culture, and tradition. It interrogates why the Africa woman seems to be out of touch with who she is. It also examines how religion and colonialism introduced patriarchy to Africans and at what point gender oppression festered across the continent.

Structurally, the film weaves an in-depth look into the lives of these matriarchs and their present contemporaries across Africa. They come together to share their stories revealing unknown information as never seen before. Shooting in a cinema verite style, we provide a fascinating window into the characters' lives, capturing and documenting their experiences and knowledge. It looks at the different regions to understand the cultural similarities and differences, the advent of gender oppression, and how to defy societal limitations. The film covers the pre-colonial African woman, the divinity of the African woman, the culture of shame, and the feminist movement. 

";s:22:"characters_description";s:2006:"Four women gather by the fire pit to share powerful stories of some of the pre-colonial African women behind the most powerful empires like the Makeda of Ethiopia, Nefertiti of Egypt, Queen Anna Nziga of Angola. And that of the women who championed some powerful movements in Africa like Yaa Asantewa of Ghana, Nandi of South Africa, Moremi/Amina of Nigeria, and others of not so royal background. The documentary unravels how these women existed, looking at their different life stages (birth, initiation, rites of passage, religion, education). It uncovers how these matriarchs resisted the colonial masters, and defied societal limitations in a male-dominated world to thrive, carving their paths to success. The stories probes if colonialism and the introduction of western religion birthed gender inequality.

The women take us on a journey into the Africa woman's spirituality and the rejection of western ideals of divinity. It tells the story from the African cosmology perspective located within specific cultures on the divine woman. They unravel how the African woman communed with God before western religion, touching on specific areas such as (the body, the mind, meditation, prayer, and self-awareness). Their stories shed light on the feminine deities that exist in Africa.
These women take us on a pleasurable journey about the African woman's sexuality and how it evolved with time. It traces the origin of female circumcision and its effect, in addition to the myth about menstruation and orgasm. It delves into controversial areas such as female husbands (women marrying women for their husbands/partners) and the LGBT society (women who love other women). Examining these issues pushes boundaries and makes the conversation inclusive.
It examines the argument among academics that feminism is too radical to be African and does not capture the African woman’s realities. They tell the stories of extraordinary women who are creating their paths and shattering the glass ceilings.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1451:"Daughters of Africa is a feature-length documentary, which uses the narrative of Five women’s journey, stories, and history to engage viewers, inform, entertain, educate, empower, and drive the story forward. Their powerful dynamic story takes place over several decades and across some African continents. Professional narration is used between acts and to set the stage for the ongoing discussion. Key narrative scenes take place in practical locations, some by the fire pit and under the moonlight depicting the beautiful African scenery. As some of the women share their stories,  we hear the trusted voices of historians and experts as they affirm convictions or disagreements and offer different perspectives that engage the audience throughout the film, it shows scenic, historic locations, archival footages, and reenactments. The film is augmented by voice-over, family photos, and videos, etc. 
The colour palette shifts from the contrast of earthy brown, orange, black to green and warm yellow. To achieve the best cinematographic picture qualities, two full-frame cameras will be used with accompanying lighting facilities. The sound will be recorded externally, using the boom, multi-channel field recorder, and lapel microphones regulated with appropriate sound equipment for ultimate audio output. Tracks, sliders, drones, DJI Ronin, jibs, and other motion picture gadgets will be used in achieving an enduring moving picture film.

The contrast I witnessed was stark. The way the people in the city carried on about their days, totally unaware of the natural beauty of the night sky that exists just above their heads - but that they are unable to see for themselves - was a harsh reminder that humans have become extremely disconnected from the natural world, and need to find ways to reconnect.

After doing extensive research, I got in touch with Professor Thebe Medupe who was very keen to get involved in any way possible. He is passionate about raising a generation of “scientifically literate” young South Africans, in order to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to make sustainable, and ecologically responsible choices into the future.

The story structure will mimic the fluid way in which San people tell stories. However, certain archetypes will be present in the film. The first part of the film will focus on inspiring. We will then delve into the problems at hand - both environmental, socio-economic and political. We will explore how political forces fractured the San communities and seriously hindered them. Similarly, we will explore how Apartheid in South Africa fostered the idea that “black children don’t belong in science”. Facing the challenges that our characters have faced, we will begin to unpack how these can be remedied and we can begin to trace a new path forward.

The film will also include both Medupe and our San characters’ observations of how society is run today, and how modern day people (particularly those in first world countries) have come to be completely disconnected from the natural world. We will get our characters views on how this can change, and why it’s so critical and urgent to implement these changes.

A new way forward will be presented - one which urges people to reconnect with their roots. ";s:22:"characters_description";s:541:"Professor Thebe Medupe is an astrophysicist living and working in Johannesburg, South Africa. Growing up in a rural village in South Africa, he would look up at the night sky as a child and become inspired to study the stars. Growing up, he built his own telescope, and later went on to study at the University of Cape Town. Thebe is now a professor and working as the deputy dean of his faculty. He has built his own space observatory in Mahikeng, Gauteng and works with South African children to inspire them to become involved in science.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1941:"This is a story about the human relationship with the cosmos, from a uniquely African perspective. The film will open with a beautiful timelapse of the night sky, with Prof Thebe Medupe’s voiceover explaining how life on earth comes from stars.

The following scene will take us into the Kalahari desert. We will hear traditional San music along with closeups of the San dance ritual - feet on the ground, hands playing instruments, eyes looking up into the sky, and fire flickering against a dark background. Our San character will explain the significance of the stars in the San culture. He will talk about how for their community, living in perfect harmony with the land has been their way of life for hundreds of thousands of years. We will include shots of the San men tracking an animal, or the way they read the signs of the environment such as looking at the movement of sand and plants. Drone shots will establish the setting of the desert. We will then move into the challenges that the San face, using creatively styled cutaways as a metaphor.

The film will allow our San characters to shape the narrative with an African voice. It will be more fluid than the typical Three Act Structure.

We will then return to Thebe Medupe as he talks about his upbringing and his journey towards becoming a professor of astrophysics. We will have shots of him in his home in Johannesburg, as well as shots of him showing us around his space observatory that he built in Mahikeng, Gauteng. We will also film Thebe in his classroom, working with children as he teaches them astronomy.

The film will comprise of sweeping drone shots, landscape and star timelapses, slow motion shots, professionally lit interview setups, emotive and astral sound design with indigenous notes influenced by Hans Zimmer’s Interstellar composition, and characters who inspire a deep fascination and wonder for our planet and its place in the universe.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:138:"Our application for a filming permit in Botswana has been submitted successfully and we expect to get the go-ahead to film in August 2021.";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:1865:"There has never been a more critical time in history for humans to reconnect to the environment. If we are to survive as a species, we need to stop seeing ourselves as separate from nature. Right now, it is more critical than ever to drive home the message that human beings depend on healthy, in-tact ecosystems for our survival. We are part of nature.

The San people of the Kalahari serve as a perfect example of how humans have been living in tune with the landscape for millennia. The fascinating, awe-inspiring night sky serves as a link between all humans that have ever lived. From both a scientific and a traditional perspective, life on earth comes from stars, including us.

Lying on the ground in Sutherland, South Africa, looking up at the night sky, this simple yet highly complex idea hit home for me. It was at that moment I decided this film needed to be made. I realised that if more people had the opportunity to experience the splendour of the night sky, perhaps that would inspire them to feel connected to nature, and to want to protect it.

Receiving a grant from National Geographic Society for this project was a massive honour, and helped me truly believe in the weight of my idea. With National Geographic backing me, I am more determined than ever to bring this film to life. With some extra production funding, I am confident that we can tell this important story at the high standard at which it deserves to be told. 

I tell stories that convey undertones of empathy, gentleness, subtly and unique leadership. I am interested in reaching audiences on an emotional level, while bringing them closer to science in an engaging and deeply awe-inspiring way. A unique balance between education and entertainment, I believe, is the key to inspiring an audience to engage with the content long after the credits have started rolling.";s:14:"representation";s:1196:"Pre-production is well under way for this project. We have secured some funding from National Geographic Society, and with some extra funding, we will be able to produce this film at the highest possible standard.

Our filming will take place in three locations: Mafikeng (South Africa), the Central Kalahari (Botswana), and Sutherland (South Africa). We have a local fixing company, Okavango Filming, on board for our Botswana leg of the production. They have a long-standing relationship with the San community of the Kalahari and understand the dynamics of the community deeply. They are helping us with obtaining film permits, and will be there to mediate between the film crew and the San people.

We aim to film Prof Thebe Medupe in August 2021 in his hometown where he built his own observatory in Mahikeng, Gauteng. From there we will move on to Grasslands, Botswana, to film the San people and their stories. In September, we will take a trip to Sutherland and film Prof Medupe there, where we will look at the science that is taking place at the SALT Observatory, and how the Prof is involved in this work.

But almost everyone I knew, from family members to close friends to strangers, had delivered via C-Section. This got me wondering how it became that giving birth, something  that our bodies are designed to do naturally, is considered no longer possible without medical intervention for such a majority. Why Science is invariably the solution to getting babies out and how highly invasive procedures have become the norm. I didn’t understand that.

My quest to getting the information that would help influence my choice was not only eye opening but also stirred the desire to empower other women as much as possible. Something that is largely lacking since most people trust medicine and medical practitioners so much more than they trust their own bodies, their own rights or their own free will. And, are heavily paying the price both financially and physically. I sincerely hope this film helps to change all that.

1. Aggie, the filmmaker who's own birthing journey inspired this film. She's strong-willed, daring and brave.
2. Lucy, the midwife that helped deliver Aggie's baby at her home residence in Nairobi. She's warm, kind, gentle and wise.
3. Dr. Charles Muteshi, the OB/GYN who they interviewed to get his views on the birthing options in Kenya. He's open, clear and honest, but also clever and diplomatic.
4. Maggie, a woman who compares her varying birthing experiences and draws conclusions on the medical practices when it comes to pregnant women. She has some regrets and advise to share with other mothers.
5. Sonnie, who shares a horrific experience with her first child under the care of a medical institution that was run like a business. The lessons learnt, the price paid, the outcomes of the experience and what has been done since. Despite everything, she is a strong, positive and generous woman.

We also need to get more statistics to back up the information shared in this documentary, as well as other experts in the matter to shaer their data or give some anecdotes.

Ils ont besoin de la quinine, cette poudre blanche extrait de l’écorce de l’arbre quinquina, reconnue comme médicament curatif du paludisme. Des ingénieurs français engagent des recherches pour l’acclimatation de la plante de quinquina dans l’Ouest du Cameroun. Après 32ans de recherches, la plante s’acclimate avec succès.  Entre expropriation des terres et travaux forcés, la station quinquina compte environ 6 millions de pieds de quinquina avec une production d’écorces de quinquina qui s’élève à 260 tonnes pour une production de 20 tonnes de sulfate de quinine environ dans l’usine qui démarre en 1955. Cette usine ne fonctionnera que 4 ans et sera laissée à l’abandon.
 Face à cette friche, les questions qui viennent en général à l’esprit sont : Qu’est-ce qu’il y avait à cet endroit ? Et ensuite : Comment en est-on arrivé-là ?
Nous nous inspirerons du processus scientifique de reconstitution, qui consiste à partir d’un fossile ou d’une friche pour imaginer l’objet ou l’être vivant au moment de sa splendeur. Et ensuite il y a l’arrêt, une sorte de mort réelle et symbolique qui enclenche le processus de fossilisation, qui aboutit 60 ans plus tard à cette friche aujourd’hui.
La reconstitution et la fossilisation sont les 2 procédés que nous utiliserons pour raconter un aspect paradoxal de l’histoire coloniale et post coloniale du Cameroun à partir de ces décombres.  FRICHE !... Et les décombres se souviennent met en rapport les acteurs directs et indirects qui ont assisté à la mise en place de la culture du quinquina, à la construction et à la mise en service de l’usine, à sa fermeture et enfin à l’abandon de la culture du quinquina.

Non loin du centre urbain, gît dans la broussaille, ce qui reste de cette ancienne usine qui produisait des médicaments pour lutter contre le paludisme. Il y a 15 ans, on pouvait encore y voir d’énormes cuves et des tuyauteries allant dans tous les sens, vestige d’une activité industrielle florissante. 
Le sentiment de peur devant la taille de ces bâtiments a laissé la place à la curiosité de savoir quelle mystérieuse histoire se cachait derrière ces ruines. Ma surprise fut grande d’apprendre que c’est dans ce lieu que se fabriquait la quinine, un médicament avec lequel ont grandi plusieurs générations d’Africains. Bien avant le sida très médiatisé ces dernières années, le paludisme reste la plus grande cause de mortalité au Cameroun. Dans le contexte actuel dominé par la pandémie Corona virus dont, selon certains spécialistes, la chloroquine, médicament de synthèse de la quinine, serait la réponse efficace, on ne peut s’empêcher de se questionner sur la tragédie de cette usine.

Dans le cadre de ses recherches, la réalisatrice est arrivée à une hypothèse selon laquelle, la question de la terre, liées aux expropriations pendant l’époque coloniale, ainsi que le désir des nouvelles élites camerounaises après les indépendances de s’approprier ce patrimoine foncier, au lieu de se soucier de l’intérêt général, seraient les raisons essentielles de l’abandon de l’usine. 
Cette quête se poursuivra aux archives nationales à Yaoundé, à Montpellier au CIRAD (né de l’Orstom et de la recherche en Outre-mer), pour comprendre comment la France a pu faire des investissements aussi importants pendant une vingtaine d’années et laisser à l’abandon une usine qui n’a fonctionné que cinq ans ? Une autre piste de réflexion est l’utilisation des médicaments de synthèse pour remplacer des médicaments à base de plantes au nom d’une modernité aux conséquences désastreuses pour la santé. Ce film sera une coproduction entre les sociétés Bandjoun Film Studio, Les Films du raphia et Merveilles Production.
Avec les Films du Raphia, une structure basée en France, nous entrerons en coproduction afin d’assurer les parties du tournage en France et aussi les finitions. Avec Merveilles Production, nous espérons faire le montage et une partie des finitions du projet à Cotonou. 
Le film sera diffusé dans le circuit CNA au Cameroun et dans les CNA des autres pays africains.
Le film sera disponible sur la chaine Vimeo on demand de la société ‘les films du Raphia’ et sur le site Patrimoines-Heritage.

Will they return home as free women?";s:15:"story_structure";s:1962:"The Republic Vrs documentary follows the story of two young women embroiled in separate murder cases and its unintended consequences on them and their families. Fati Issa; arrested and charged in 2014 with conspiracy to murder in the death of a banker was in prison remand for four years. Despite the physical and psychological toll of attending monthly court hearings, and the difficulty of raising her two-year-old child in a notorious slum, she remains hopeful. In 2018, Rita was remanded for stabbing her late boyfriend in a domestic abuse incident which resulted in his death. Their two-year old offspring, Wisdom is Rita’s strength as she goes through a lengthy court trial. 
As we follow Fati and Rita in and out of court, we get a glimpse of the boredom and routine of their lives, the danger of being in the grip of the law and the devastating effects of poverty and crime on women, children and the community. Will they return home as free women? If found guilty by the jury, they could face the death penalty. The film reminds us of Ghana’s laws; laws that grip the guilty and innocent; laws that require revision; laws that are enforced and those that are rarely mentioned. 
Through this documentary, we come very close to Rita and Fati’s ambitions and fears. We also see Accra’s buoyancy and its dormancy, the colour of its open markets and nearby sprawling neighbourhoods like Agbogbloshie where Fati lives. We see the frustration of passengers in traffic, worsened by noise pollution from old vehicles. The scene is a woven fabric of disconcerting cultural phenomenon. As for Fati and Rita, they constitute part of the low class urban poor who live on $2 daily. 

The Republic Vrs is an opportunity for everyone to reflect on life, freedom and privilege. To young people, it is a reminder of how prison can rob them of their productive years. To government and NGOs, it is an urgent call to reform policing and criminal investigation. ";s:22:"characters_description";s:1936:"FATI(30) FATI lives with her partner in one-bedroom crib in a crowded house at Agbogbloshie, a notorious slum in Accra. Fati is unemployed, but occasionally gets laundry work in her neighbourhood. In 2014, she was arrested for Conspiracy to murder along with four others. She spent 4 years in Nsawam Prison has been attending Court trial since 2017. She and her partner have a 2-year old son whom they take care of from taking cleaning and errand jobs. 
 
When fights and brawls breaks in the compound among the younger girls, Fati cautions them, occasionaly speaking Dagbani, a widely spoken language in the northern part of Ghana. Alone, she breaks down in tears while recollecting her time at Nsawam prison, how she went days without eating, how she grew lean, contemplating suicide many times. She regrets the situation but is also shocked about it. What will her family think when they see her in the newspapers with damning headline as a murderer or accomplice? 

RITA (27), victim of domestic violence, arrested in 2018 for murder, refused to abort baby, gave birth while in Prison. Has a 2-year old son. Attends monthly court sittings, awaiting trial. RITA lives with her parents, siblings and her two-year old son at Dome, a suburb of Accra. In the mornings, she assists her mother prepare Maize porridge for sale, after which she goes to hawk tupperware at Dome market. How does she tell her child when he’s grown that he was born in a prison? Before the incident that led to her arrest, she sold selling oranges. 

NANA ADWOA (32) UK-trained lawyer who works with Fair Justice Initiative, a human rights law firm based in Accra. Just returning from maternity leave, she combines full time work with full time babycare. The organization allows her to bring her baby along to work in Accra. Outside working hours, Nana Adwoa loves to spend quality time with her family, go to cinemas or just stream movies on weekends. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1006:"The Republic Vrs is cinema verite documentary, following the subjects directly. This gives the audience direct access to the story which creates empathy. Set in Ghana, the film is moving, solemn at times and boisterous at other times as we see contrasting landscapes and socio-economic divide. Shot over a period of five years, the audience witnesses the physical, psychological and emotional changes occurring in the lives of the subjects. ‘Sisters-in-law’, a documentary of how two women (prosecutor and judge) use the law to rescue women who are victims of domestic violence in anglophone Cameron, is a good reference for our film. 

Fati and Rita’s own narration leads viewers into the themes explored in the documentary. Key scenes occur in practical locations such as homes, churches, court, market, prisons, with an emphasis on movement. 

B-roll of menial workers in markets, families in amusement parks, schools will be used to give perspective and contrast to the subject’s situation.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:656:"We have filmed a fundraising teaser. We have started pre production to film principal photography. At the same time, we are doing more research as well as following up with our protagonists. This month, I received communication from the Ghana YMCA that there may be funding opportunities for my protagonist to support their skill acquisition under their projects. We intend following through with this and filming. 

The Republic Vrs has been selected among 25 projects under the Presidential Film Pitch Series organised by the National Film Authority of Ghana, a pipeline facilitation program to connect filmmakers with investors from around the world. ";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:2006:"My decision to produce a film on human rights spurred from a random discussion with Jonathan Osei Owusu, founder of Pos Foundation, an NGO that runs the ‘Justice for All Programme’ in Ghana, who told me how there are people who spend up to fifteen years in pre-trial detention in Ghana. This got me thinking for days.
Meanwhile, I had decided that my next project will be about human rights. Not sure which way to go, I began talking to lawyer friends, through which I eventually met Nana Adwoa, a human rights lawyer through whom I got to know my protagonists, Fati and Rita. 
I thought these young ladies have stories that many people can learn from, the danger of being in toxic relationships, and living in slums with high crime rates, the brutality of an unforgiving criminal and prison system, the psychological turmoil that going to prison causes, the stigma, the diminishing of human dignity and the will of survivors. 
Fati is determined to prove her innocence, and to use her story to educate other younger girls like her who migrate daily from the Northern part of Ghana to the south in search of work. Fati is currently unemployed, and dependent on her partner. Without formal education, she appears to be giving up on empowering herself economically. I am curious to document how she would evolve over the long period of filming, and to see what she does about her situation. 
I’m curious about the outcome of their trial and how it affects other facets of their lives. Rita and Fati believe their story will enlighten other young people about life and living it. 
I am ready to commit at least four years to making this documentary. Seeing how Nana Adwoa and her organization Fair Justice Initiative, is supporting less privileged young women inspire me. Going to court with Fati in mid-2020 was my first time in any court. When the court clerk called her case, the title of the documentary ‘The Republic Vrs’ struck me. By end of court, I was certain this is my next project. ";s:14:"representation";s:856:"9th May, 2021

Note of Intent
This is to acknowledge my commitment as a producer to work with Shakiru Akinyemi on the documentary project titled, “The Republic Vrs.”

Personally, I believe the urgency of this project in addressing lapses in Ghana’s criminal justice and investigations cannot be emphasized enough owing to similar prevalent cases that needs the attention of the right local and international authorities, hence my readiness to stretch my abilities on this.

Having successfully worked on other films that have won awards and reached millions across Africa and the world through online and offline mobile cinema tours, I am confident the mapped out distribution and marketing channels will push the project beyond the intended projects.
I am excited about this.

Elle est la chaire du dispositif narratif. Elle vient nourrir, contextualiser, étayer, documenter
les épisodes par la parole d’experts et d’intervenants reconnus. Ici, ce sont les enjeux historiques qui s’expriment. La grande Histoire. Celle enseignée, celle en recherche, celle parfois oubliée et que nous souhaitons mettre en lumière dans chacun des épisodes. Iconographies et archives. Pour accompagner la plongée des spectateurs dans une époque et des espaces géographiques qu’ils méconnaissent. Pour aider à donner la mesure de ces empires et ancrer le récit dans une réalité, la série s’appuie sur de l’iconographie, mais aussi des images d’archives souvent contemporaines qui permettront d’illustrer le propos : fouilles archéologiques, évènements, actualités, cérémonies du FESPACO, etc.
Une carte animée. Cette carte au graphisme travaillé est un élément essentiel dans la structuration du récit. D’un point de vue géographique, elle permet au spectateur de se situer à l’intérieur du continent africain. Elle sert également de clé pour voyager dans le temps et doit faciliter les passages d’une époque à une autre pour retracer l’épopée d’un empire depuis sa formation jusqu’à sa chute. Réalisée en animation, elle permet enfin de zoomer ou dézoomer à loisir et de mettre en scène les ellipses (construction de villes, grandes batailles, extensions d’empires...). La fiction incarnée. L’absence d’images, d’iconographies et d’archives pour figurer le passé, nous amène à convoquer la fiction. Une fois le décor planté grâce aux cartes, nous plongeons dans de véritables scènes de fiction, incarnées par des acteurs. Ici, ce sont les enjeux humains qui s’expriment, les petites histoires derrière la grande Histoire. Des émotions universelles qu’on retrouve depuis la nuit des temps, dans toutes les civilisations : amour, haine, trahison...";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2010:"Quand Sébastien Onomo m’a parlé pour la première fois de l’idée d’une série documentaire sur les grands Empires africains, j’ai eu la même réaction que n’importe qui : j’ai reconnu n’en avoir jamais entendu parler. Ni à l’école, ni par
mon père d’origine africaine, ni dans les médias que je consomme pourtant beaucoup, ni même au fil des nombreux projets historiques, scientifiques ou sociétaux sur lesquels j’ai pu travailler pour Arte ou France télévision. C’est ce qui m’a interpellé et convaincu de la nécessité de m’investir dans ce projet. Quelques discussions en France, notamment avec Josza Anjembé, Françoise Ellong, Daouda Coulibaly et Chris Macari, les réalisateurs(trices) de chaque épisode, et quelques voyages sur le continent africain plus tard, il m’était devenu
évident que cette ignorance n’était pas mienne, mais qu’elle était partagée dans le monde entier, jusqu’en Afrique même. Il s’agissait donc de relever le défi, de rendre compte, enfin, avec un point de vue historique mais aussi humain, des trajectoires de femmes, d’hommes et de peuples africains qui avaient été littéralement oubliés. L’objectif était en réalité double : s’adresser à la fois aux africains du continent, à ceux de la diaspora partout dans le monde, mais aussi aux autres, à tous ceux qui, n’ayant aucune origine africaine, n’en seraient pas moins fascinés par ces pans entiers de l’Histoire humaine dont ils n’avaient jamais eu connaissance. En ce sens, la forme du documentaire ayant recours à la fiction historique pour “mettre en scène” l’Histoire, que je connais pour l’avoir souvent utilisé dans mes films précédents (notamment la reconstitution historique de la traversée de la Manche de Louis Blériot, en cours de réalisation pour Arte) m’a semblée la plus  pertinente. Il fallait faire face à l’absence d’archives, mais aussi capter l’attention de ce public, aussi large que possible.

Nicole’s mother, Susan, gave birth to her first born, Nicole, at the age of 16. Susan too was born and raised in the slums of Kibagare. When she realized that she was pregnant, she moved in with her then boyfriend and that was how her family began. Susan’s  neighbor is her mother.  
Nicole’s story cuts across three generations of Matriarchs who have lived and grown up in poverty. 
Nicole’s grandmother, Nicole’s mother and then Nicole. They all have their lives orbiting around Kibagare Slums.  A bill to introduce sex education in Schools in Kenya was tabled in parliament. However this was met with strong opposition from religious leadership. With no sexual reproductive health information, , this then means that a girl, born into poverty, in the slums of Nairobi, will most likely get pregnant as a teenager and then drop out of school. She will then live her life, tethered to the slum.  This vicious cycle is the machinery that eventually leads to a surge of teenage pregnancies.  
 We will explore:  
1.	Nicole’s Family Background 
2.	Her Environment growing up and the influences around her 
3.	Her teen pregnancy journey 
4.	Poverty as a link to early pregnancy and broken families  
5.	Nicole’s journey back to school after spending a lot of time away  
6. Linkage between Nicole's story and her peers.

Apart from losing his social and family life, now depending on therapy to improve and being part of a support group together with fellow victims, Wahinya has not yet fully healed from what he underwent when he was arrested.

In the film, he takes us on a journey from childhood to university, as he narrates how he ended up at loggerheads with the government of that time. This is not displayed chronologically but instead intertwined with scenes of this current life.

Besides highlighting just a portrait of Wahinya, the story deeply captures the pursuit of justice and recognition by the forgotten ‘second liberators’ of independence in Kenya – a pursuit that has been ignored by sitting governments for years. The film follows their journey as it unfolds, gives room for the accused to respond and finally leaves it for the people to conclude.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1195:"Wahinya wa Boore is the main protagonist of the film. He is a 66-year old charismatic man who currently resides at his rural home in Nyeri County in Kenya, and often visits his family in Nairobi. He does consultancy work on human rights and social justice issues for various organizations and also engages in small-scale farming.

He is a former political detainee and a torture survivor, having spent 6 years in incarceration and 46 days in the former torture chambers located at the basement of Nyayo House in Nairobi. And though many years have passed since he was released, he hasn’t fully recovered psychologically and also ails physically often due to the brutality he endured.

However, he is a resilient man who does not give up easily, as is visible in his pursuit of justice for the atrocities he underwent. His character embodies the spirit of the National Victims and Survivors Network (NVSN), an association that champions for the recognition of victims of human rights violations in Kenya. Wahinya is the Secretary General of the association and a firm believer in fighting for what is right. He is bold and vocal when it comes to challenging authorities that oppress people.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1636:"The film is mainly observational, where we follow our character over the period of production. We will have multiple character interviews in different locations and showcasing different experiences that our character undergoes. As we have complete access to him, the film will feature a lot of intimate scenes of his personal life at home, with family and with friends. We intend to capture the deepest emotions possible. One of the major sequences will be the annual visit to the former Nyayo torture chambers. Here, we have our character walking among other former detainees who have already formed an association together, and they freely interact, reminding each other of their experiences during those days. He also walks into the chamber where he was jailed as he describes the physical structure of the cell and the purpose for each section. This culminates into a moment where they gather together, light up candles, sing songs of freedom and make chants. Afterwards the leaders of the association give updates on how far they have gotten with their pursuits and later disperse.

Another sequence will be his frequent visits to the hospital where he goes for therapy. After checkup he goes to the nearby market where he meets his childhood friends who have great admiration for him, as we see and hear from their interactions.

Also, as the association keeps on its pursuit for justice from the government, frequent court proceedings, parliamentary petitions and protests will create a stronger narrative for the film.

This episode will focus on rugby and look at Khaya Malotana and Makazole Mapimpi. Malotana grew up in Jojweni Village in Lady Free about 20 kilometres from Queenstown in the Eastern Cape. He became the first Black African to play for the Springboks in 1999 and went on to become a respected television commentator and presenter. He has also coached numerous schools, club and university teams.

Mapimpi grew up in Tsholomnqa, a small rural village near Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape. His rugby career did not follow the typical route of most of his peers – strong school then provincial contract and finally the national team. Instead, he played amateur club rugby until he was 24 years old and was discovered by the now defunct Border Rugby Union after his club won a local tournament. He went on to play 14 matches for the Springboks and became the first South African player to ever score a try in the Rugby World Cup Final.

This episode will look at the divisive history of rugby in South Africa, and how the sport was popular in the Black communities. There will be an archival look at some of the players who were denied the opportunity to play for the national team prior to 1994. The episode will then move to Lady Free to look at where Malotana grew up, speaking to his family and friends. There will also be an interview with the Headmaster of Queens’ College, where Malotana played until his matric year. 

Another insert will be filmed in Tsholomnqa, with Mapimpi’s family and former teammates. There will be shots showing the fields where the local village rugby tournaments are held and juxtapose those against the lush stadiums where provincial rugby is played in South Africa. 

Both sportsmen will be asked about the challenges they faced growing up, their role models, how growing up in rural areas shaped their careers, etc.

The athletes’ stories are illuminated through the biographical approach, telling the stories with a beginning, middle and end. Since the athletes are alive, the “end” will look at their current endeavours and future plans. 

Narration is provided by a narrator using a third person, talking over picture montages and video clips to inform the viewer on the athletes’ journeys. The narrator acts as an observer, conveying the facts of the athletes’ lives and career experiences. 

The athletes’ interview clips act as first-person point of view throughout the film, informing and entertaining the viewer first-hand about their life and career highlights. Other characters, including family members, teammates and coaches, are also interviewed and give their own opinions on key moments in the athletes’ lives.

She’s also frustrated with how conversations about progress in Matabeleland are all hinged on the past. Particularly the state-sponsored atrocities that took place in the 1980s. 

Chris disagrees. Since the government killed his father in 1983 - he believes that he has been living under a curse placed by the angry dead whose bones have been scattered across the country. This curse has tainted any efforts to progress in life. Now living as a struggling migrant worker in neighbouring Botswana, Chris is adamant that only a change of guard and the reburial of his father will lift the ‘bad omen.’
 
Shari is obsessed with bones. She believes she can heal people such as Chris by exhuming the remains of their loved ones. She tries to do this while navigating her identity as a white Zimbabwean in a divided country, and the realities of her uncomfortable and violent colonial heritage.
 
Until 2017, all these desires felt impossible. But then the unimaginable happened when President Mugabe was ousted. That spurs the beginning of public exhumations. With Shari’s help, Chris manages to return his father’s bones to his rightful homestead.

But as racial and tribal tensions are at an all-time high, Chris desperately wants to return home, but not empty-handed. Meanwhile, Noku starts volunteering in hopes that she will eventually be gainfully employed. Shari faces a personal tragedy of her own; can she find acceptance in a community designed to shun her?

Will any of them be able to move forward when so much of Zimbabwe remains stuck in time?
";s:22:"characters_description";s:1986:"Chris Nyathi is a 60-year-old man living and working as a migrant worker in Gaborone, Botswana. The oldest of 11 siblings, he is the head of his family and has carried this burden since 1984 when his father was suddenly killed by the military during the Gukurahundi atrocities. Despite his efforts to financially provide and guide his siblings, he becomes convinced there is a curse on his family, which is the cause of all their economic, professional and personal struggles. When he finally manages to return his father’s bones to their rightful place, Chris still feels cursed, pandemic lockdowns in Botswana leave him unemployed and feeling out of sorts. He tries to rebuild but his new quest becomes, like his father in many ways, to return to the place he came from Matabeleland.

Sixty-three-year-old Shari Eppel started her career as a psychologist working with victims of state-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe. When trying to counsel the victims of the massacres seemed insufficient, Shari discovered the only way to bring healing to the people of Matabeleland would be to first bring healing to the dead. She does this with the hope that the future generation and her granddaughter, in particular, will grow in a Zimbabwe that has come to terms with its past. This proves very tricky for Shari who also has to grapple with her identity as a white Zimbabwean living in a very racially polarised country.

Nokuthaba Neshiri is a 23-year-old hopeful living in a largely marginalised and economically depressed Matabeleland. Her dream was to go to university, but it’s been years since she left high school and her family still cannot afford to send her to school. But still ambitious, she tries to get a job and work her way up, but the prospects for her are not promising. She wants to stay and invest her efforts into her community but she’s growing frustrated “When will it be our time?” she asks and argues that the country needs to stop obsessing over the past.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1150:"‘Healing the Dead’ is primarily told through verité scenes and intimate moments of Chris, Nokuthaba and Shari’s lives, supplemented by archival material. In Gaborone, Botswana we see Chris’ daily life as an immigrant while he carries the burden of being the head of the family and household. In Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, we film scenes with Shari and watch her navigate through communities in rural Matabeleland as an anthropologist and her life as a grandmother. And in urban Nkulumane, we see Nokuthaba active in his community. These scenes will be supplemented with landscape and atmospheric footage of dry savannah of south-western Zimbabwe where the massacres took place. This will be juxtaposed with stylistic footage of colonial buildings, vintage cars, and dilapidated factories throughout. This will provide a metaphorical exposition of how Zimbabwe is stuck in time and how the country has frayed over the years.

From this experience, he wrote a book where he expresses his hopes for his home village. With his wife Laura, a Spanish who migrated to Senegal, they developed projects around a community of young volunteers from both Senegal and Spain with their association HAHATAY.
Yaye Khadi, Mamadou’s mother, is looking kindly at the situation as they attempt the building of an ambitious community center and give a positive example to a youth tempted to Migrate. 

The film follows them in those construction and integration processes within the village of Gandiol. Will their active utopia withstand the hardships of the local realities?

Gandiol is a fishing village in northern Senegal, just before Saint Louis. On a coast dotted with palm trees, it faces the menace of an advancing sea which destroys more houses every year. Gandiol saw many young people leave, including Mamadou Dia in 2006 in a pirogue towards Spain.

Even today many young people from Gandiol envy their elders who left and returned "rich".

It is within this environment that Mamadou, returned to engage with the young people of Gandiol by setting up projects trying to fight against their departure in pirogues, and creating opportunities for them. Some remain skeptical and do not adhere to their vision, they do not understand why he wants convince them to stay.

They have their own dream of departure, one they hold dear.
Laura supports Mamadou, she also has her personal challenges in this context where she is a foreigner : her fears and doubts about the future of their family. She faces all the pressure that weighs on them every day, in the implementation of projects, the management of the community house.
After having implemented many initiatives, Mamadou and Laura are at a critical moment in their development: they are facing professional, economic and relational difficulties which will inevitably affect their future";s:22:"characters_description";s:1548:"This film is like a Sérère polyphonic song, with three Voices and a Choir

•	Mamadou, The Lead Voice

We follow Mamadou after 5 years of his return. He’s building a center of community development. How will all this impact him ? The challenges, the failures. What does returning mean to him and the people he his working with.

Sometimes Mamadou in his moments of loneliness will drive us into his utopia, his hopes and doubts. And the beautiful landscape of Gandiol and the sound will help us to get into the head of Mamadou, contrasting with the  challenges and conflict of the center.

•	Laura, The Soloist 

Laura, Mamadou’s wife, is the second voice. A Spanish woman who migrated to Senegal. She worked here, met Mamadou here, they married and she chose to commit to his project. What does it mean for her ? To integrate without disintegrating herself ? How does it impact her, her children, her couple ? Will they be able to build a post-colonial relationship ?

•	Yaye Khadi, The Rythm

The third voice, she’s the bridge between his son Mamadou and the traditional village. She is the guardian of the temple. Interviews with her and scenes will give us depth to our story and anchor it in the specific environment that is Gandiol.

Mamadou will drive us into this initiatic road with him and his people. Their song is echoing with the voicing of this ‘Choir’, all the voices of the village that will sometimes appear, whether on the marketplace or behind the empty spaces our main characters go through.  
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2008:"The desire of a “choral film” to sketch a contemporary tableau, that of a generation committed to building its dreams…

Through the character of Mamadou Dia, we will discover the situations, the characters and the challenges of social change, which is above all an individual change.

The reality of everyday situations in which we embark with him will be told through captured scenes and moments of life: my camera will follow Mamadou in his steps to move forward on his project. His team meetings, the important encounters with the village community, seeing in negotiations with authorities ...

We will Discover his difficulties and how they influence his personality. The debates and conflicts with the young people he is trying to convince. His ability to adapt to reality at the risk of losing his dream. We will film his reaction to challenges, his reintegration process.

Through Laura, I will film the interaction with Mamadou’s large family and with residents of the village, to reveal the complexity of her position, to confront perspectives, to film the process of integration. Sometimes I will isolate Mamadou and Laura to see how they manage their married life; discover them differently, in the closeness of their doubts and hopes, to perceive their fragility.

Mamadou will make us discover, the character of Yaaye Khadi, his mother; the one who advises and mediates, the bridge towards the authentic culture of the village. Her story and presence will offer moments of intimacy to Mamadou, but also a deeper sense to the life and history of this village and community

The goal is to see things from their point of view, and to follow this emotional process.

This creative documentary also intends to reflect, through symbolic images and sound constructions, the utopia that inhabits the head and heart of Mamadou, using excerpts from his book - describing his dream, filming the poetic environment  of this village to build fragments of this utopia which is activated";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:864:"In March 2021, our first filming took place in Gandiol. The purpose of this shoot was to gather images that would help building the narrative structure of the film, and test some of the aesthetics the filmmaker meant to implement.

The rough assembly we are submitting as a sample is trying to show the different elements that will constitute the core of the film : a poetical and introspective perpective to our characters and their surroundings, a strong musical presence, and a narrative embedded in captured cinema direct scenes...

Saliou Sarr worked on this sample with the assistance of an editor. Their main focus has been to put all the elements of the film on display rather than the editing process itself, which is still at its very early stages.

The return is both joyful and difficult, bringing us face to face with the reality of change, the people and places we have found again, in a new light. 
The one who returns has also become someone else, even a stranger in his own home, he will have to change again to find a place in the society to which he is returning.
This film was born out of the desire to tell a modern African story, an example of a young man who chose to return home after years of hiding to make a commitment, despite all possible difficulties.

The desire to give a voice to young people like Mamadou, to expose his dream and the obstacles he faces, a way to accompany his quest with the production of images, his desire to renew the discourse and to recreate the relationship to oneself and to others.

Through Mamadou, I wish to hear other voices around him, those of Laura, of the young people of the village, of Yaaye Khady and of the village of Gandiol.  Like a Serere polyphonic song, where the singer is surrounded by a troop of choruses that respond to his phrasing, sometimes cutting it, covering it and intertwining it as if to weave a speech with different meanings, different rhythms and melodies!

The desire of a "choral film" to sketch a contemporary tableau, that of a generation committed to building its dreams, which does not resign itself to difficulties, which opens up paths of possibilities.

My trusting relationship with Mamadou and Laura allows me to film very closely and above all to live the hopes and fears in this adventure, to observe from the inside.

To film the process of reintegration of this migrant, to show that the journey does not stop for the one who dreams and returns home, the process of change impacts first of all the one who commits himself to it in order to transform the world, without being sure to succeed.Making cinema to transform reality.";s:14:"representation";s:1866:"With Doxandem, the dream chasers, Saliou Sarr highlights one of the most important societal issues of our time. Subtly, this film finds itself at the crossroads of all these major themes that are currently dominating the debate on migration. It can therefore only be a valuable object for an audience that is too often exposed to a discourse devoid of nuances on the issue of migration. For today, it is no longer about stories, still less about adventure or Odysseus. Everything is reduced to unfathomable statistics.

By choosing an aesthetic approach, through cinema, to such a subject, Saliou Sarr becomes a witness of his time, as well as the spokesman for a youth whose voice is too rarely heard without being altered, and invites the spectator into his gaze. 

The project has just began its production. Our first shooting took place March of 2021. Additional shootings during summer and the fall will unfold. We wish to accompany that process while still looking for additional finances. 

Provided that those steps are successful and accomplished on time, we wish to complete the film for a release by the second trimester of 2022. This process had been boosted by the success we encountered in many development Lab : The Ouaga Film Lab where we were awarded 3 prices including a participation to the latest IDFA Forum, The Miradas Docs Lab where we were recipient of the Durban Film Mart award where we are set to participate in July. 

Led by our co-production partners STEPS, and with the support of the different partners of the film, this distribution strategy will be based on the integration of this project into the documentary collection Generation Africa. Its momentum will be reinforced by the submission and expected participation of the work at major film festivals around the world as well as through effective digital communication.

The film interacts with Peter Mutiso who was a student in form 3 at the time the fire smoke filled dorm and a pain on his leg which would later on be a scar from where he got burnt.

When the fire happened, Ng’ao remembers waking up to smoke which was blinding his vision and fire. At this point he asked God a question, “God what do I do?” in Kamba and he remembered advice from his dad.

Weaving together moving interviews and rare archival footage, Defying Ashes will portray, for the first time on film, the individual journeys of the survivors of this fire tragedy, their pain, and the enduring power of resilience and will. 
Through the lens of these two survivors, the documentary film, Defying Ashes, will examine, with affection and insight, what it means to experience tragic loss. Following the struggles of these two men who at the time were just boys, it will give audiences a window into the turbulent tides of the last 20 years. 
Their stories will help us understand our story as a people. Fire being a perfect metaphor for the world of tragedies and the value society (African) places on counselling and how we treat victims of tragedies. 
Leading up to the 20th anniversary of the fire, Defying Ashes by contrast will turn the story on its heels and provide a refreshing twist, by showcasing the victims perspective and putting a survivor at the center of the story. It will anchor the tale of two boys(now men) who experienced the same tragedy but their lives turned out completely different from each other. 
When did we get that way and how? Defying Ashes dares to suggest answers. It dares to probe into these people's lives. It dares to suggest that the choices we make and those made by our families and the society around us makes us who we are. 
Our documentary, though, will do more than provide historical insights. At its core, it will probe the shifting relationships between friends as their dreams and realities respond to the winds of change sweeping through their lives.

This beautiful medium-sized black woman, born the year of our independence, in 1960, lived intensely: a long eventful life of 52 years, between several continents and aspirations. She is my mother.

In August 2012, she flew from Paris to Dakar, the capital of Senegal. On the eve of the Korité, the holiday marking the end of the month of Ramadan, it is presumed that she traveled towards Guinea by taxi. After that, nothing. Mariama literally disappeared.
This Essay-Documentary is not a biography, nor an analysis or investigation into her disappearance, but rather a reflection on permanence and impermanence. This film was born from the need to answer this question: "What do we leave behind?”. What traces, what prints can a life leave behind? Aside from the memories? What is really left of us and of our passage on this earth? 
This quest on my mother's personality will be done with testimonies I will collect with my camera, by retracing who she was thanks to the sensory traces she left around her on her relatives and her family. From my two grand-mothers, to her three husbands, along with my siblings and her close friends, all people that I’m filming are either members of my family or friends of my mother. Many of them have been wounded by life and society, especially the women. 
I will articulate the passage from one stage of My mother’s life to another, not chronologically, but by analogy. I will use different material such as historical and intimate archives - pictures, sound, video, and my drawings and animation to “substantiate all that is insubstantial”. 
The backbone of my film is the letter in voice over that I address to my mother. This letter is written in very peculiar tones, in which I intend to use intimacy and humor to reflect the exuberant and colourful life of my mother. 
In the landscape that is our collective memory, I’ll chase my mother’s tracks.

My Maternal Grandmother, Aissa Ly

Aissa was born sometime around the 1940s. Her exact age is unknown. She is a Peul. Her family is one of the noble families that guided the Toucouleur kingdom in Tooro. In my grandmother’s family, men are all imams or religious guides, from father to son. 

Aissa was an extremely strong and independent woman for her times and social class. A true feminist. She had seven husbands and eleven children.

My mother and grandmother never got along, but still, they could not live without each other for very long. As for me, I instantly fell in love with my grandmother. 

Today, Aissa is a plump old woman who looks more like a turtle. She does not believe that my mother is dead. She thinks she vanished on purpose, and is secretly living in the United States. She has kept many photos, of herself, my mother, and the family. 

My Father Elhadj Thiaw

My father never stopped loving my mother. He even tried to marry her a second time, when my mother divorced her second husband. Although we were separated until I was 27 years old, he was always supportive and loyal to me, when he found out my mother had vanished. He is the only one who has helped me to find out what happened to her. Both of us believe that my mother is dead, probably murdered by her last husband. 

My stepfather, Michel Roseau:

Aside from his dream of becoming a professional guitarist, my stepfather had two other passions: photography and motorcycles. He liked to shoot and print his own color portraits, and he was fairly talented. His life as a wealthy expat was smooth and easy, until he met my mother.I don’t what he thinks of the Vanishing of my mother. It’s been almost 18 years since I saw him, and we lost touch. Seeing each other again is likely to be a bit uncomfortable. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2025:"I see The Vanishing as a drawing, a sensorial object, a tactile epic tale on screen. My film will display features akin between the personal story and the documentary essay. This hybrid form reflects the lives of both my mother and myself; in other words, our cultural blends. The shape of my film will be created from four items: 
Filmed Image: Filmed in Cinema-Verite style- the testimony of those who knew and were close to my mother. By filming them, I’m seeking in their memories what she has left to them. And piece-by-piece I will draw her portrait. I plan to interview and film both of my grandmothers, my mother’s three husbands and three other children, and her friends. There will also be archival footage to give a counterpoint with political or historical background. These official archives can be seen as a complement to what I call the “private archives” that our family has kept, of my mother. 

Photos: To collect the testimonies of her relatives, I will ask them to rely on photos of themselves but also those they have of my mother. I am seeking to emphasizes the imprint, we leave behind us, with the interplay with the filmic or photographic component when you’re in the darkroom and the image on the film slowly appears. I will often use a photo as a device, either to evoke memory and speech, or as a medium that gives life to my mother’s body over the course of time. 

Drawing: Drawing was an essential part of our life as a family. Drawings and paintings allow me to “materialize” all that is immaterial about my mother’s life. I’m using animation in certain poetic moments which are either referring to dreams, mind mood and to the non-visible world that is part of my Senegalese culture. I’m using an old handmade technique, a rostrum camera. 

Music: Music was the artistic basis of my mother’s lives and resilience. Instead of asking a composer to write a soundtrack for the film, I shall choose seven emblematic songs to make the Sound Track of Mariama’s life.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:547:"The project is still at the same phase production wise. In the past month we had the opportunity to prepare an important scouting filming that will take place in the coming weeks as well as a development workshop involving the director, the editor Niels Pagh Andersen and animator Marie Opron that will take place at the end of the summer. 

The purpose of these events is to push towards the end of our development phase and have a final scripted treatment. 

Following our production schedule, we will enter our financing phase accordingly. ";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:2004:"How will I make an invisible visible?When I examine my mother’s journey, from her birth to her late decisions, I see a never-ending struggle.

She had to fight prejudice and discrimination of which she was a victim for being a woman with a modest background, African and Black on top of it all. In societies like these, to cope with the multiple discriminations against you: you must find and create in yourself multiple types of resilience, to overcome and transcend these visible and invisible violent forces.

Violence can be used against oneself or, on the contrary, for oneself. But in every case, this energy must travel, be channeled, and pour out. Because violence is in flux; it is never static.

Every time Mariama confronted violence, she resisted with her own weapons. Sometimes with the quest for knowledge, with access to schooling and the Arts. At other times with political activism. Finally, when she dealt with even more complex forms of violence, she resorted to spirituality to survive. It guided her in dark times.

My life is a prolongation of hers. I exist primarily through the foam of her imprints. As a Mauritanian- Senegalese who lived in Europe, in the answers I mustered to resist the same struggles she endured.This is why I decided to tell my mother’s story in light of such a special prism. When I analyze my filmmaking desire, I can also analyze the rhetoric of violence and art as resilience, resistance, and redemption. 

Filmmaking and Vanishing are two opposite poles on a single axis. Vanishing means that one is no longer visible or apparent to others, whereas making this film about my mother's disappearance is making her visible to others, forever visible on a film. Implicit in the action of filmmaking is the revelation of my background. I publicly display my own invisibility: by going back to the sources of my own mysteries, demystifying them, and using the Image to reveal them. Making The Vanishing is an act of opposition to the vanishing. ";s:14:"representation";s:1994:"The Vanishing highlights the life of an invisible person, invisible by her gender, skin color, social background and history. Beyond that lies another undisputable truth : her vanishing made her physically invisible to us. She became a shadow, a ghost. This is a beautiful cinematic and human challenge. This film deals with the traces that we all leave behind and is, for that, reason meant to move audiences.

Stories of black women are starting to reach a wider audience. They should no longer dive back into invisibility. This project is a generational story that will speak to anyone interested in African communities and their diasporas. 

The director's approach is to tell us a historical resistance/fight through an intimate point of view combined with collective History, circumventing actual proliferation of set images and unfolding in several countries.

As the project is entering it’s financing phase, and after a development for which Boul Fallé Images gathered several financial supports and industry nods(CNC, Hot Docs, Scam, Ciclic…), our most recent and prestigious recognition is the Visions Sud Est award the project received at the Pitching du Réel in Nyon. To meet the ambitions of the project, we need time. Time of several shootings in different countries. Months of animation with Marie Opron, months of editing with Niels Pagh Andersen. The high estimate of budget is mostly due to the crucial importance of animation, archives and music in Rama Thiaw's vision.

Our coproduction strategy in order to finance the film reflects these realities. One of our primary goal is to make sure the film remains in majority a Senegalese and African production. The co-producers we are gathering at an international scale (Switzerland, Germany, Mauritania…), such as our first partners at Films de Forces Majeure (France) all share this imperative and the importance to make themselves useful allies in solidarity with our fight to keep our patrimony in Africa.

Glow went to a gay bar she normally goes to with her friend to have a good time, at some point in the night she needed to use the bathroom and went to the Female Bathroom. The doors in the stools don’t close properly so she pushed the door open and the lady inside pushed back at her, she knew someone was inside and decided to wait for her to finish. When the lady came out of the bathroom she asked Glow why she was using the Female Bathroom, and insisted that she should be using the Male bathrooms and this led to a verbal and physical altercation. This led to a court case that we followed with Glow which is one of the many politics that she faces as a Transgender woman in society. Through the emotional labour of fighting for her place in society, Glow continues to stay true to herself and her identity. We follow her as she gets her testicles removed, so she lives in a body that reflects who she is. We follow her in her daily life and find out the realities of no representation for Transgender people which makes her feel erased but also making it known that she will never erase herself, we see this through her work as a model and an activist. 

Olawumi Fakayejo ( 26 years old) is a Nigerian woman who was raised in a polygamous home. We find out how growing up in her home has shaped Olawumi’s views on relationships, gender roles and what a happy home looks like to her. 

Mwaka Magula (29years old) is an Entertainer from Zambia. She grew up with a father that was in the Arts and knows the power of Representation and was inspired to be in the same space herself. She is now one of the lead actresses in Zambia’s first telenovela called Zuba. She speaks about what she knows Representation for black women to be and how she wants to change that representation through the attention that she gets as a celebrity. ";s:22:"characters_description";s:1947:"Olawumi grew up in Akure, Nigeria in a Polygamous home which is very common in those parts of Nigeria. She’s the oldest of her siblings and grew up very close to her mother, and saw the effects of the divorce between her parents when her mother was removed from the home with her children. Olawumi was very close to her mother who spoke very openly about sex, the struggles in her marriage and how important it is to have sexual pleasure. We see the effects of having a sex positive mother and how it’s freed Olawumi
in her life and approach to romantic relationships. Her mother passed away shortly after her marriage from Cancer, and now she’s the closest thing to a mother that her siblings have. Olawumi just finished her first year of marriage which is said to be the hardest, and the first year without her mother. She depends on her husband financially and that comes with some politics, and we see how her Christianity affects the way that she approaches her relationship.

Mwaka is a Zambian Actress, she stars in Zambia’s first Telenovela Zuba, she has her own YouTube channel, works as a Script Writer and Journalist. She knows and understands how important representation is, having grown up with a father in the Entertainment industry. Zambia is a very conservative country, and it stops a lot of women from expressing themselves and feeling liberated. Mwaka has created a platform where she is able to do that with the women in her life, and uses her fame to let other women see her doing it so that they are brave enough to do it in their own lives.

Glow was born in the Free state and raised as an only child by a single mother. She is a Transgender woman that started her medical transition in 2016. She moved to Cape Town after she finished high school and graduated at the University of Western Cape in 2014, she wanted to work in corporate but has found it very hard to get into because of her sexual identity. 
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1357:"The visual approach of the film will be observational, walking with them in the journey of their lives to see small and big ways they contradict themselves with the things they say in interviews and the way they live their own lives. This will be achieved by following them in their family settings, the way they are at work, the way they are with their friends and the way they are when they are alone. We will focus on one issue at a time so it’s easier to link the politics they have in different contexts, because they will be cut into happening at the same time.

These three stories show Representation for black women in different contexts, starting with a lack of representation for Transgender women, to negative representation for black women, and the lack of representation again for women in African Traditional settings. These politics will be shown at the same time, as the women navigate the tension between them and the politics of sex. We will show them in their individual lives with many politics including sexual violence, the pleasures of sex, their first sexual experiences, religion, tradition, history, activism, money and sex, sex work and the LGBTIQ community in Africa.

Would he leave the only place he ever knew?";s:15:"story_structure";s:1041:"The New Man or the exploration of the intimate relationship of Man to Time; the opposition of time standing still in an abandoned village to time passing by men which confront us with our own mortal condition. The story of Quirino is also the confrontation of tradition and modernity, of man’s attachment to the Land, of his relationship with Nature. 

The story takes place on the island of São Nicolau in Cape Verde, in Ribeira Funda, a small village located at the bottom of a deep valley surrounded by high mountains and a rough sea. After a series of tragic events occurred its inhabitants taken by a superstitious frenzy abandoned the village, attributing the tragedies to forces of evil. They all left to settle in a neighbouring village, Estância de Brás. All of them...except one. A man stayed: Quirino. 
For more than thirty years now Quirino David da Cruz, 76 year old, has been the sole inhabitant of Ribeira Funda, the ghost village. 

Now Quirino is moved to the other village would he survive his new surrounding? 
";s:22:"characters_description";s:924:"During all these years, Quirino has refused help from the local authorities and friends to move him out, to these initiatives he has never ceased or respond with pride that Ribeira Funda was the land where he was born and where he will be buried. He survived all these years by fishing and getting vegetables from his own garden. He spends his days gazing at the ocean and the majestic mountains that surrounds his home. His only company is a rooster, a few sparrows and portable, battery powered radio which brings information from the rest of the world. 

But today Quirino, faced with uncertain future and the grueling weight of isolation, disease and old age, Quirino hesitates. For the first time in his life, he’s starting to accept the idea that he might need help of others to survive. However, Quirino is not alone: he lives among his memories and images of a world that existed - and that is no longer there.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1687:"The film follows a non-linear narration that embraces the different spaces and temporalities experienced by the main character - solitary - and the in- habitants of the neighbouring village. It will follow Quirino’s steadfast daily life, facing an environment of dizzying beauty and hostility. The documentary also follows the steep path that leads us from the ghost town where only Qurino’s radio disturbs the silence to another wold so far, so close, so full of life. The film travels between these contrasting places, and from desert to animated returns, the film explores the different points of view on Qurinio’s voluntary solitude and his desire to continue his life in the place he has always known or to move to this other place which he perceives only fragments. 
Three different approaches allow us to apprehend the soul that represents this isolation. The first takes a contemplative approach in order to capture the relationship between the character and the environment in which he evolves. The second adopts a more creative style in order to give a feel of the fantastic dimension of this universe. The narration does not hesitate to transport us to a fragmented temporality in which we come to question what’s happening on the screen: is it the present, a recent past, Quirino’s imagination or his memories that recreates the abandoned village of Ribeira Funda? 
The third approach in the extension of the previous one then embraces a more intimate engagement, more focused on the direct feelings of Quirino. 
The second part of the story is complete contrast to what our character is familiar with. This time he is the one observing the life beside him.

Since we had an important event that happened, even though it was always considered a possibility, with our main character. Because of his fragile health and the covid19 situation that could put him in great danger, he finally left the ghost village after 38 years. For us it’s been a great challenge to adapt to this new circumstances but in the same time a blessing in terms of creative possibilities.
This new situation forced us to rethink some ideas, concepts that it was only possible with the events that happened in the past months. 
We had the opportunity to travel back to the island and capture this new reality that right away seemed much more rich and interesting. Today we have our main character living in the village of Estancia Braz, the place that almost 40 years ago the people who left the other village, Ribeira Funda, went to live. This creates a complete new environment for our character, living among the ones that he always refused to follow. But also, to live with his sister, ironically the first one that left the village, contrary to Quirino who was the last one to do so. We are now connecting with him in this new setting but also the whole dynamic of this new place. The film become a possible metaphor about transformations. The effect of time on the places and in us but also about the transformations of these places and Quirino itself. 
Since these are recent events that happened we don’t have new written material to support it but instead we edited a 15 minute sample with new footage that allows us with this visual material to show and support these new ideas, concepts, pace, mode and intentions we want to explore in this continuing new journey.
";s:14:"representation";s:1075:"-	I have been invited to apply for Venice GAP financing market with one of my projects. I applied with THE NEW MAN trusting that the project would benefit from such respected platform which will allow us to examine the international market possibilities and collect feedback for future references.  We are now waiting for the final decision which is expected during July. However, this process allowed us to explore a couple of universal themes that would make THE NEW MAN accessible to wider audiences, such as climate change and its influence on our everyday life and mind set. Nevertheless, we understand that we are navigating slightly unfamiliar visual representations of time and space that truly special to our character, Cape Verde’s islands and their inhabitants. Our mission remains hopeful that we tell a very personal authentic story in an authentic setting that full of local cinematic punctuations and conventions to attract worldwide audiences without comprising the simplicity and complexity of our character and his unique environment and landscape.

Her frequent Facebook postings are an indication of the rise in physical and sexual violence, she uses social media to defend and fight for victim’s rights and to link people who need help and those who can help.

The documentary will adopt a cinema verité style and will document Njeri as she goes about rescuing victims using Facebook to involve the general public in her efforts, it will follow the stories of 6 women for a period of 6 months from the point of rescue, to the unknown and uncertain future. 

By covering Njeri’s everyday life, we see what keeps her going in the face of her successes, failures and lack of concerted government support, the cost that she and her family has to bear to keep her rescue operations going, plus the sacrifices she has had to make in order to create a future for the victims.

Through her, we shall get access to supportive law enforcement officers, organisations and individuals who assist in legal matters and financially to safeguard Njeri’s campaign.
The documentary will cover all facets that combine together to bring to light the plight of gender-based violence victims, the scope is on the social, legal, economic and political aspects that have contributed to an increase especially during lockdown due to Covid-19 

The use of Social Media by Njeri to bring her fight to light is innovative and immediate and she able to galvanize action in real time, from raising ";s:22:"characters_description";s:414:"Njeri Migwi-Mwangi believes that her calling and her life's purpose is to rescue victims of gender and sexual violence, she has made rescuing and helping victims her life mission.

A journey fraught with brutal conflict, sacrifice and loss, held on course by love, resilience and African women.

Using unique personal access to the subject and his family and rare archive material of post independent Uganda and beyond, the film is both a poignant love letter to the Ugandan education system and a reflection on the experiences that shaped Prof as a person. It is a deeply intimate meditation on how to build a prosperous, unified Africa envisioned under Pan-Africanism and the African Renaissance, one small seed at a time. This is the story of African Higher Education and the urgent need to educate the world's fastest growing youth population before it is too late. Before the chance to harness the opportunities presented by the digital revolution for the world’s fastest growing economies is lost to others more skilled. 

";s:22:"characters_description";s:1878:"In 2021, Professor Adipala Ekwamu is retiring as a university professor, distinguished researcher, recipient of an honorary doctorate from University of Gweiza (Sudan) and having assisted more than 2500 students with scholarships to pursue studies in crop sciences. It’s a very different world from his upbringing as a herdboy in Olyanai, Uganda. Yet the values taught by his adoptive grandmother Ada Akello - now 100 years old - and the hard-won formal schooling paid for by the village women including the village witch doctor, are the foundation for a 40 year academic career contribution to realising a Green Revolution in Uganda and establishing an illustrious pan-Africa network for crop scientists.

The oldest of 13 children and the only sibling to receive a formal education, Adipala’s journey is from a tiny arid village through the hallowed halls of Uganda’s top schools and prestigious Makerere University to a doctorate obtained in the USA against the backdrop of Uganda’s torrid and brutal post-independence history and the collapse of education under Idi Amin and later the deplorable Joseph Kony and his Lord’s Resistance Army. 

Upon his return from the USA in 1992, Adipala sets about planting the seeds for a revitalised agricultural science revolution in Uganda that grows into a network of 10 universities across five African countries by 2004 and is set for even greater successes when the unthinkable happens: his wife is diagnosed with throat cancer. In the painful years after her passing, he throws himself into his work and expands the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) to 114 partner universities across 38 African countries. 

“Every life journey is an unfinished journey. And when you or I or anyone else is gone, there will be others preparing to take our places and carry on our work”.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1821:"This feature documentary utilises an observational and participatory approach as the camera follows the protagonist Prof Adipala: he always invites the camera and viewer into his story with a friendly “You are welcome, please come…”. This irascible story-teller, great intellectual yet down-to-earth childhood mango-thief is is the heart of the film, creating a mood of bittersweet nostalgia but with an understanding that the past is not a fairy tale idyll. Although Prof grew up in the most unstable decades of Uganda’s recent history, often brutal and violent, his vision for the growth that comes from that is infused with connection to the ideal of a pan-African renaissance, grown through networking, a celebration of diversity and commitment. 
  
The film gives us access to a mostly unseen world. With a powerful central protagonist – a natural orator - it is a character-driven story that digs deep into universal themes. Dreams, struggles, family, love and loss. An uncertain future. The story of the underdog. Our protagonist trusts the camera and is open, honest and emotional, giving us intimate access to a colourful, brutal, hopeful and brilliant life story. The personal narrative carries with it the story of a continent and it’s people. Africa’s pain and resilience through a violent past, struggles for independence and the lasting wounds (and benefits) of colonialism. We experience a new perspective on Africa’s youth, it’s tertiary institutions and the race to prepare those youth for the rapid growth and opportunity presented by the continent as the next emerging global economy. Will our protagonsit’s lifelong struggle for a Pan African youth that are skilled, prosperous and proud of their Africaness, be able to carry his baton forward? A whole continent depends on it. ";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:490:"As part of our preparation for the Durban FilmMart we are receiving mentorship regarding the narrative structure of the film and look forward to sharing the project in July. 

A shoot in Uganda is looking possible for July that will be funded through another project but we will need to schedule one more shoot in November in Benin when Prof Adipala retires - this will be a key sequence in the film. 

We continue to work on the rough cut, applying for funds and seeking co-producers. ";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:1376:"My motivation for telling the story is to reveal to a global audience, a world seldom seen. A brilliant, exciting and brutal world that challenges traditional narratives of Africa as a broken, hopeless place. A world of young people fighting for their future and the right to their own continent. I have made 58 short films for Professor Adipala and the RUFORUM Network since 2013. I’ve visited 28 African countries am deeply immersed in the current conversation about African Higher Education and it’s challenges and critical role in African Development. 
I have come to know Prof Adipala very well. And I believe I have been given rare access to his personal and emotional life. I’ve learned about the role of capacity building for young scientists and their institutions on a continent with the lowest scientific output. I’ve seen firsthand the impact of young scientists and their innovative technologies for their communities. Many times lifting whole communities out of poverty. I have seen the potential of the ‘new African scientist’ and I want to amplify that story so that the dominant narrative of Africa is challenged. 
The chasm between science and development generally, and the public requires skilful communication to cross. Complex themes need to be simplified, carefully humanised and made emotional through the medium of visual storytelling.";s:14:"representation";s:1142:"The film has benefited from extensive filming in Uganda and a 100 minute rough cut of the footage is available. We intend to return to Uganda for a final filming opportunity once COVID-19 safety considerations allow, preferably before November 2021 when Prof officially retires from RUForum as this will be a natural point of reflection for him. We hope his 101 year old grandmother Ada will accompany him to Benin for this retirement celebration as it will be the first time she travels away from her home and will showcase everything he has achieved in his career.

We are participating in the Durban Film Mart’s Finance Forum in July and hope this will introduce us to funders and co-producers.  

We hope to gain input from an executive producer during the post-production to give us input on the narrative structure of the film, archive search. We also need to rework and incorporate an archive search for the “history lessons” that reflect the changes in Uganda’s political and education landscape and the creation of bespoke music and sound design. Our main priority is to find a co-producer to assist us in this journey.

However, as every other slum dwelling, competition for a better livelihood coupled up with negative societal vices such as drug abuse, Kibera has produced several individuals and gangs that have terrorised the city in general. With low employment rates, young people have sought refuge in such vices and have in turn lost their freedom and lives in many cases. However, some have, voluntarily or otherwise, turned their lives around and sought better and legal ways to earn their livelihoods. An example of this is a group of reformed criminals who have formed a self help group, "Mwamko Kwa Vijana" that collects trash and cleans a local popular market, Toi Market, for a fee paid by the market sellers. As a group of around 15 former criminals, their main agenda is to work together as a group earning a legal income and not backsliding to crime, as well as trying to persuade peers in the night life to do the same. I met this group in 2020 and filmed their story (as the DOP) for a documentary by China Global Television Network(CGTN). The documentary is about the hidden talents, potentials and positive stories of Kibera, this groups story being a small part of a greater narrative.

Isaiah: Was a popular footballer, a husband and a father. To fend for his family, he turned to crime, mostly as a pickpocket in Kawangware. Fearing for her life after several warnings from friends and family, his wife one day left their son in the care of their neighbour, with the promise to be back shortly, never to be seen again. Isaiah's life turned around when he was caught in the act and beaten up by a mob almost to death. Right now he will do anything to ensure a better future for his son, a very talented dancer.
Biko: Frank Biko, referred to as "Chairman", is the leader of the group. He, together with several others, set up the group after he had served a jail sentence for burglary and struggled to find employment once he rejoined the free society. 
Steven: He is a silent figure who made the switch when they attempted to carjack a vehicle at gunpoint without realising the vehicle behind it was a police car.

Practicing Ubuntu, that nebulous concept of common humanity and oneness, “I am because you are”, belonging to a collective, unselfish Revering our forefathers. She was cognizant of representing her family's name, and all that it encompassed when she left Africa with a dream. This was her only support for what could be a crazy story. 
Being a part of apartheid South Africa and the impact it had on the Indian community too, added another layer of who she was, her very identity, and the choices she would ultimately make in India.

She belongs to the Indian community from South Africa, and grows up in a society that holds on to a culture it brought with itself some 160 years ago. Early on, Tarina’s grandmother taught her the importance of sexual abstinence before marriage and what it requires to be the ideal Indian girl.

With this moral compass embedded in her, Tarina, embarks on her international life, in her teens. While at medical school in India, she is spotted by talent scouts and offered modeling jobs.  Soon she finds herself totally immersed in showbiz as if she was destined for it. She appears in over 100 TV commercials and on countless billboards all over the country. After learning the local language, she forays into the Bollywood film industry; starring in over a dozen global blockbuster Indian films. 

Barely out of her teens, Tarina was already living the life many can only dream of: flying first class and in private jets, living in 5-star hotel suites around the world, shooting huge campaigns and earning a ton of money. However, what actually was going on behind the scenes was the complete antithesis of this world of glamour. In fact it was a dark world entrenched in deceit, drugs and debauchery. And Tarina was right in the middle of it. 

She gets a peek into the Bollywood promiscuity and is offered the casting couch. On the one hand, she has to maintain this perfect image that she had so well-curated and on the other, she would cry inside because someone regularly violated her sense of morals. She was not just representing herself but also the name of her family, the community she came from, her culture and her traditions.

THE LIONESS is going to be a 4 part documentary feature, with each part running between ca. 45 minutes. The narrative will be from the view of Tarina, but different perspectives will be shown from directors, producers, designers, and co-actors, etc. 

Tarina will retrace her journey– visiting the places studios and meeting the people she has worked with in the past. This way the audience will get to travel with her and immerse themselves in the world Tarina works and moves. Though real-life scenes will be captured in 'a documentary' style including interview sessions with Tarina, there is scope for re-contructing a few scenes that have occurred in the past. To construct the past events we will also incorporate footage from past TVCs, films and pictures from print media campaigns. New and fresh material will be shot of Tarina's role as an actor possibly against the green screen and edited with archive material. 

The aesthetics and shooting style will incorporate glamorous high key lighting. We plan to shoot with either the Arri Alexa Mini which can be easily rigged on a gimbal or the Sony Venice which is known for its low light sensitivity. 

We will also shoot TVCs for the brands she has worked with in the past.

Right in front of
Senegal, the small archipelago is known for its rich musical culture, having as its biggest ambassador the worldwide
recognized Cesária Évora.
For Patricia, music represents a small haven from her reality and a chance to become famous and change her life. She
prepares herself to compete in the second season of a local singing completion tv series while she takes care of her
newborn baby and her older son that, like her, has inherited a degenerative blindness. The 5-year-old child has also
abruptly stopped talking, increasingly showing signs of autism.
And who will cook? has been a constant question in both her and her mother’s lives by the men who, after getting
them pregnant, abandoned them for being blind.

PATRICIA MAIA
Only 23 years old, Patricia is the mother of a 3-year-old boy and has recentlygraduated high school in Achada São Filipe. She is completely blind on her left eyeand almost completely on her right one.
Patricia lives in São Pedro’s neighborhood, Praia, Cape Verde. She has known rejection from a very young age: first from her father who abandoned her when she was still a baby, then from her primary school teacher, the father of her son, etc.
Even so, she managed to study through ADEVIC, she speaks Creole and Portuguese and some French and English.
Patricia dreams of being a singer. She doesn’t want to be dependent on state funds forever, and wishes to be economically independent so she can have her own house
and raise her son.
She has recently started dating someone new, who appears to be very supportive of her condition and her dreams. She is torn between wanting to be the best mother
she can be to Kenny and actually enjoying being young and pursuing her dreams freely. She attempts to do both.
She is very concerned about her son’s health and wants to try and prevent him from going blind and understand why he has stopped talking. She is the main character and the narrative evolves around her.
TITIA
Titia, Patricia’s mother is completely blind. She was also abandoned by the two fathers of her daughters. She works as Patricia’s mentor and gives us context from her birth and how she was raised.
She lives with her two daughters and her grandson, Kenny.
Titia is very active and is always busy at ADEVIC’s workshops, batuku rehearsals and doing cakes and sweets that she then sells.
KENNY
Patricia’s son, Kenny, is 4 years old and already shows the same symptoms – losing his sight as time goes by. He as also stopped talking recently, which is an alarming sign of regression. He does not have any relationship with his
father and Patricia is the one who raises him with the help of her mother. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1263:"“And who will cook?” will be a character documentary and will be shot mainly in cinema verité style. We will follow
Patricia while she prepares herself for “Voice One”, a local TV competition series, which will be the leading thread of
the documentary.
Sound will be immensely important in this documentary because it is the sense that allows Patricia to “see”, so it will
have to be our primary sense to be activated. If there’s a fly in the room we’ll need to hear it before we see it.
Music will also be a fundamental element throughout the film. Not only does it represent a dream for Patricia but it
also illustrates Cape Verde. Therefor it will be present in Patricia’s life in multiple ways – her humming songs, her
rehearsing for the competition, on the radio at her house, on her batuku rehearsals with other blind women and also
as a transition between sequences.
Patricia, like her mother and her older son, has been losing her sight gradually.
In “And who will cook?”, we’ll explore that concept visually through the focus. We’ll begin the film focusing exclusively
in Patricia and her family, having everything else unfocused. As the documentary progresses we’ll increasingly start
focusing on everything.

They took the first step of bravery against all odds.  They didn’t entertain the colour of their skin or their gender. They lived in a time when being black was almost a curse, yet they were able to rise above that.  They didn’t do it for themselves but for their fellow men who were despised and degraded in every possible way. They set up a stage and today many others can follow in their footsteps. 
These are stories of triumph.  Today South African women can enjoy their freedom and be able openly speak about the challenges they face but before all this, Bertha Mkhize had to be brave. She had to stand up for every woman who came before her and those who came after her. Like Bertha KE Masinga also did something remarkable when he walked into a white only SABC building in Durban and became the first black radio presenter. For the first time black people could listen to their own language and be proud. Another brave man was Simon Mkhize who ran the comrade marathon six times unofficially before he was to be recognised. He loved to run the 80 km marathon but he was black and it took longer for him to receive a green card.  Another brave woman who went against the odds, paving the way for others is Sibusisiwe Violet Makhanya. She became the first black social worker in South Africa.
These documentaries will give us a glimpse of the historical foundations to different disciplines. We shall learn about the participation of black people in different fields in the era where black people were refused participation. These documentaries will open the doors to the world and history of broadcast, sports, literature, business and social services in South Africa. This was the time when one needed to be brave in order to achieve their aspirations. These stories will be intertwined with today’s world in order to understand how we arrived where we are today.

These are schools where Bertha received her education before she started teaching. She taught until she was thirty years and called it quits in order to pursue her business passion.  SIMON MKHIZE was born in 1942 in Howick. He grew up in a farm in Underberg . He then moved to Pietermaritzburg where he started running at the age of 28.  BUSISIWE MAKHANYA grew up in Mbumbulu in KZN and like all other village girls she collected water from the river and did all other chores that were expected of her. When she was nine years old she attended the Inanda Seminary School for girls. In 1927 she earned a scholarship to study in the US. MAGEMA MAGWAZA was born around 1840 in Zululand to the Ngcobo clan. Magena was also a messenger for Colenso, sending messages to King Cetshwayo. This gave him an exposure to the Zulu royal family and he developed a relationship with the King, who he described as “good, kind and loved by his people”. KE MASINGA was born in 1904 in Mzumbe. The story of KE gives us an opportunity to explore the history of radio in South Africa. The radio in South Africa started in the 30’s from humble beginnings as a platform for the wartime report service, propagating certain ideals and values from a central source.

Ubungoma is a documentary, which seeks to educate audiences on the practice of Ubungoma, with an added emphasis on the reconnection of Africans to our identity and ancestry. The inspiration of the documentary bore from my own experiences with my former partner's journey as iSangoma/Traditional Healer & my curiosity this subject matter  & how little is known about it particularly in a younger demographic. We aim to explore the relationship between spirituality and modernization, religion & demonstrating how the world co-exist as opposed to collide.

Participatory Documentary

A deep dive into the world of African shamanism.

ACT 1 – UBUNGOMA
The first act serves as the foundation of our subject matter, Ubungoma. We want to evoke emotion from the viewer straight out the gate. The establishing shot of the Sangoma dancing in this scenic view. Focusing not just on the movements but the emotion of the dancer this will be highlighted by using close up shots tightly cropped right alongside wide angles of the sunrise, which will set the scene

ACT 2:   THONGO LAM
This part focuses on educating the viewer on various types of spirits and the way they manifest themselves within their host. Showing the various distinctions and their importance showing how multifaceted it is 

ACT 3:  INKATHAZO
Here we begin to explore the legal ramifications associated with Ubungoma. We dive straight into our first interviewee, the esteemed Makhosi Dhlamini. We want to keep this footage as raw and unrehearsed as possible. Many handheld shots following her around her practice just to give it an intimate feel. Our interviews will be shot with two cameras, our main establishing shot and our second cam focusing on cutaways and secondary shots (tightly zoomed into our subject’s faces to give their stories more raw emotion). We want to keep the backdrop as clean as possible to ensure minimal distractions from the points discussed in the interviews

ACT 4:  HEEDING THE CALL
Inthwaso (initiation) is the very reason that this concept for the film came to be. Our DP, Dino Benedetti’s cinematic eye giving an interesting take on shots of Thwasa’s (initiates) going in to initiation. Depictions of various ceremonies and tying them all together to form a view from the Thwasa’s perspective. We introduce the following interviewees: Gogo Esme, Gogo Malepena, Gogo Muhlavasi Emma Kejoe & Gobelas’ from Mpande’s representing ama Ndau and Mnguni who detail their journeys as well as taking through their various practices

After an invitation to help with the inaugural edition of an African Wild life film festival, an emerging filmmaker is introduced to a world of filmmaking they have never encountered. After watching the opening night film at this nature festival called "A Plastic Ocean", their view of the world, the ocean and the anti-plastic campaigns changed.

They start to wonder about their life and their choices. They start recycling even more and using less plastic - they even almost turn Vegan. But as they ponder about this new information and as they speak to others about what they know regarding the ocean and plastic in it, the filmmaker realises that
something they hold very dear to their identity also poses a plastic threat - their hair.

The filmmaker is a hair enthusiast and hair lover, having made previous films about hair and forever finding ways to incorporate hair in any project they do. They also love changing their hair frequently using extra hair to create colourful braids and having braided hairstyles in various colours. The realisation of this conflict causes them to re-think their anti-plastic position - does this mean there will be no more braids? But her grandmother had braids and so did her great, grandmother for sure. Braids are
part of her cultural identity... how does she resolve this issue?

Through their search into the history of African braided hairstyles and frank conversations with other African women who have a close relation with their hair, the filmmaker seeks to finds the general awareness and care amongst other African women regarding issues of hair and identity and the world
and conservation.

But the habit and tradition of braiding is too hard to abandon.

Through a training opportunity where she learns how to dive, the filmmaker has yet another encounter with the ocean, this time it is up close in the great deep.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1888:"Since beginning my journey as a filmmaker, my films have had a strong focus on identity and the various sub-headings under that theme. Hair has been a big central theme and something that continues to fascinate me. My previous fictional feature film, "Hair That Moves", explored the story of a young girl who didn’t like the hair she has and does all that she can to get her hair to move like the people she sees on tv. "Rapulani!", an animated short is also about a young girl this time with a magical afro whose best friend is Rapunzel. With the new project I want to propose however, I want to move away a little from fiction and look through a more adult lense... but still continuing with my enthusiastic fascination with hair.

Through my previous and current hair projects, I have had the opportunity to be invited to various festivals and seminars to speak about hair and identity and have there met other hair enthusiast who work in this niche field. My interview list includes some of these professors and hair artists I have met
and hopefully they will also share their own personal links and fascination with hair.

With the ocean motif we want to play with, I am still in contact with an organisation called N.E.W.F. that invited me to learn how to dive for the first time and the dive instructors and would like to go back to that life (and hair) changing place. The dive instructors have open access to all the dive points in the Sodwana Bay area in South Africa so we have a lot of underwater landscape to play with. We will also
procure some archive footage from this same organisation.

The documentary is a personal documentary, using my story and journey with hair to link various themes, interviews, chapters in the film as I ask questions about the past and heritage and questions about the future that challenge my choices and the future I want to create.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1542:"As I was doing research into the history of braids and the hair industry, I quickly saw how this piece could easily become an investigative piece as there are many complex things in the black hair industry and of course black people's view and relationship with their hair and the historical influences - both African and
non-african is also complex. However as interesting as the facts were surrounding black hair history, I still really wanted to tell a personal story about my own journey with my hair and extra hair and pay homage to my African heritage while still including my interactions with the ocean - both onscreen and in
the real.

So I imagine the ocean, its depth, its darkness, its light, its danger, its freedom and its different landscapes becoming like a motif throughout the film. My moment underwater was quite a
transformative experience and I want to relay varying parts of those moments throughout the film through the re-occurring images of the deep sea and my hair underwater.

I also wanted to use self tapes or recordings I make of myself whenever a thought or idea comes to mind that is linked to the film's issues. I thought to do this as most of the tension of this story is really taking place internally, in my head and I don't know of any other way to reveal this.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:4431:"Emmanuel reconnaît sans ambages son dilemme : « Si l!on me confiait la responsabilité, à moi seul, de le juger, de décider de lui appliquer ou non la peine capitale, je serais bien en peine de condamner ce tueur qui me redonna la vie, à un moment où elle ne tenait même pas à un fil ». 

La vie d!Emmanuel, 40 ans, est marquée du sceau d!un traumatisme enfoui au plus profond, qu!il exprime pour la première fois en revenant dans ce lieu- dit, Mugonéro au Rwanda, où à 13 ans, il manqua d’être massacré comme le furent, ce jour-là, des milliers de personnes, dont sa mère et sa sœur, du seul fait qu!elles appartenaient à l!ethnie Tutsi.

En réaction, Emanuel crut trouver sa sauvegarde en s!engageant dans la légion étrangère pour être résolument du côté de ce qu!il croyait être la force. De cruelles mésaventures clôtureront le chapitre de cette illusion. 

En revenant à Mugonéro à la rencontre d!autres protagonistes de son drame, témoins de ces terribles évènements qui ont fait basculer en enfer sa paisible existence d!enfant insouciant, le souvenir d!un homme surgit de sa mémoire. Un homme qui détient une clé, à ce jour énigmatique, de sa vie. Emmanuel est à la recherche de cet homme, Ezéchias Mujyemangango, un criminel, qui fut son professeur. Celui-ci se terre, dit-on, quelque part au Cameroun.

Cette recherche n!a pas pour finalité de retrouver un fugitif pour le dénoncer afin qu!il soit arrêté et déféré devant la justice. L!objet de cette quête est de susciter les retrouvailles entre une victime, enfant rescapé du génocide et ce professeur qui lui sauva la vie, envers lequel cette victime se sent à jamais une dette et auquel, par ailleurs, il veut se confronter. D!abord le remercier, même s!il n!ignore rien de ses crimes. Puis, percer enfin ce mystère, la raison qui incita cet homme à l’épargner et à le cacher. Pourquoi, il n!usa pas de son autorité pour sauver aussi les deux jeunes qui se trouvaient dans la même cache qu!Emmanuel ? Pourquoi lui seulement ? Emmanuel était-il la part du butin de guerre humain du professeur, à tout «saigneur» tout honneur ? Et les deux autres jeunes, la contrepartie de sang que le professeur devait concéder aux excès meurtriers de ses hommes pour pouvoir emmener avec lui Emmanuel ? Est-ce à ce partage qu!Emmanuel doit la vie ?   

Et cette vie sauve d!Emmanuel rachète-t-elle ou atténue-t-elle tous les crimes du professeur ? Emmanuel est hanté par ces ombres sépulcrales qui rôdent au- tour de lui depuis ce jour. Devoir la vie à un tueur, dans le contexte de ce génocide, le plonge dans d!insondables questionnements qui font écho à sa culpabilité de survivant. 

Le plus choquant dans cette tragédie rwandaise, comme en Bosnie, ce fut un massacre de proximité. Hutu et Tutsi de ce lieu-dit se connaissaient de longue date, étaient liés pour certains par des alliances familiales, fréquentaient la même église (les Adventistes du 7ème jour), avaient le même pasteur - Elizaphan Ntakirutimana -, célébraient le même Dieu et se référaient au même texte sacré dont l!un des dix commandements, le sixième, prescrit : Tu ne tueras point. Malgré cette communion, une folie collective et meurtrière s!est emparée d!une très large partie de la communauté Hutu, au point de lui faire oublier en ces quelques jours d!apocalypse toute humanité.

Moins de 24 heures après l!attentat visant l!avion qui transportait le Président Juvénal Habyarimana, le 7 avril de1994, les massacres de Tutsi ont commencé dans tout le pays, orchestrés et attisés par la Radio des Mille Collines. 90% de la communauté Tutsi est exterminée, plus de 800.000 personnes, entre avril et juillet 1994. 

En creux, à travers ce professeur, ce film dressera le portrait d!une certaine nature humaine dans l!expression de sa monstruosité triviale, celle dont sont capables des êtres ordinaires abdiquant soudain de toutes valeurs morales, recourant à la violence ou étant témoins passifs, des êtres que l!on croise tous les jours - un voisin, un collègue, un ami - cette abjection dont parle Hannah Arendt et qu!elle qualifie de banalité du mal.

À l’exemple du financier du génocide, Félicien Kabuga, âgé de 84 ans, arrêté le 16 mai dernier à Asnières-sur-Seine, sous une fausse identité, après une cavale de 25 ans. J’intègre l’idée, qu’un film pourrait en cacher un autre et me prépare à cette perspective qui obligerait à réaliser un autre film que le projet pensé. L’éventuelle impossibilité, malgré nos efforts, de recueillir l’accord des protagonistes principaux impliqués dans l’histoire d’Emmanuel, particulièrement ceux qui ont participé activement au génocide, ou de certains témoins directs, par crainte de leur sécurité, déporterait le projet du documentaire vers un nouveau sujet. L’éventuelle dissimulation des principaux protagonistes, leur fuite, leurs stratégies d’évitements, éclairera d’une lumière crue, par défaut, le sujet premier du documentaire, la recherche d’Emmanuel pour retrouver le professeur qui lui a sauvé la vie et comprendre la sidérante et effrayante ambivalence qui a fait cohabiter, la monstruosité et l’humanité, en même temps et en un même être. La difficulté d’Emmanuel à atteindre son but deviendrait alors un nouveau propos et engendrerait un autre film par effet de sérendipité. Ce ne sera pas un motif à déception ni à renoncement, tout au contraire. J’aurai l’opportunisme en bandoulière pour composer avec tout ce qui adviendra. Si le film ne s’offre pas tel qu’initialement conçu, cette dérobade ouvrira un autre champ fécond et donnera naissance à un autre film connexe…Ce qui importe n’est pas le but à atteindre mais le chemin emprunté, la démarche d’Emmanuel pour se reconstruire en questionnant et en essayant de comprendre, à travers son histoire, ce qui dans la nature humaine semble au-delà de l’entendement. In fine, c’est l’étonnante résilience et le parcours de vie d’un homme, Emmanuel, enfant rescapé d’un génocide, dont tous les actes sont marqués du sceau de ce destin singulier, qu’il m’importe de suivre et de raconter. LE DISPOSITIF FILMIQUE Emmanuel sera le fil rouge de ce documentaire. La caméra traquera son émotion au plus près lors du retour sur les lieux du drame, l'expression de son ressenti quand il sera confronté aux témoins des évènements, à la résurgence des souvenirs douloureux ; et particulièrement si la rencontre avec son ancien professeur a lieu. J'essaierai de capter ses moments de trouble, de colère, de silence, de recueillement, de larmes, d’interrogation, pour traduire l'indicible vertige de sa tragédie. Nulle voix off de commentaires, autres que celles des protagonistes. Ce sera la restitution de la vérité brute et nue. Au terme de notre longue série d’entretiens préparatoires, j’ai demandé à Emmanuel ce qu’il ressentait après avoir exprimé pour la première fois tous ces souvenirs. - « J’en tremble encore », me répondit-il. « Toute cette histoire est au fond de moi depuis si longtemps. Il fallait que ça sorte. J’espère que tout cela aboutira à quelque chose. » - « À un film », lui ai-je promis... et à sa possible reconstruction. « Il y’a quelque chose de plus fort que la mort, c’est la présence des absents dans la mémoire des vivants », me dit Emmanuel.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:108:"Il n'y a aucun élément supplémentaire à ajouter au dossier du projet " Le tueur qui me redonna la vie".

Mon histoire avec Emmanuel Sakindi Bakareke débute avec l’amitié que j’ai nouée avec sa
sœur aînée, Consolata, à Paris, en 1986.
Lorsque j’ai rencontré Emmanuel pour la première fois, il avait 16 ans. Il en a 40
aujourd’hui. Il séjournait en France lors des grandes vacances d’été. Il était hébergé chez
mon plus vieil ami d’enfance, Georges, le frère de cœur que je me suis choisi, ami aussi de
sa sœur.
Nous savions l’épreuve tragique à laquelle Emmanuel avait survécu miraculeusement. Il
était rescapé du génocide du Rwanda. Il avait alors 13 ans. De cette histoire, il n’en disait
mot. Nous en connaissions que des bribes. Une mère, une sœur et un frère, ainsi que tous
ses amis périrent au cours de ce génocide dont furent victimes les Tutsi.
A 21 ans, Emmanuel s’est engagé dans la légion étrangère et régulièrement il séjournait
lors de ses permissions chez mon ami. Il était devenu le quatrième membre de la fratrie de
cette famille.
Après la très dure épreuve consécutive à un accident de voiture dans lequel il fut
impliqué, qui se solda par le décès d’un homme de 23 ans et la peine de prison - 6 ans
ferme dont il écopa, Emmanuel vint s’installer, après 28 mois d’incarcération, chez mon
ami, Georges.
C’est cet homme brisé, qui n’en laissait jamais rien paraître, auquel l’armée après quatorze
années de service actif avait tourné le dos, que j’ai retrouvé en début février chez Georges
dans le cadre d’un diner où je suis arrivé avec un peu de retard. Je prêtai l’oreille à une
conversation en cours. Je compris d’abord vaguement qu’Emmanuel parlait d’une
rencontre qu’il avait faite il y a 2 mois, qui semblait l’avoir terriblement ébranlé : la
rencontre avec son ancien directeur d’école de l’époque du Rwanda, un Hutu, chez lequel
il avait dîné. Cet homme figure sur la liste des génocidaires, recherchés par la justice
rwandaise. Il a acquis la nationalité française. Devenu avocat, il vit tranquillement en
famille en banlieue parisienne sous sa véritable identité.
Nous étions tous autour de la table sidérés par le récit que nous faisait Emmanuel et
étonnés de l’entendre pour la première fois évoquer cette page jusque-là tue de son
histoire.
Cette rencontre dans les environne Paris avec cet ancien Directeur d’école a réveillé les
fantômes qui l’habitaient, qu’il était parvenu à enfouir au plus profond de lui. De son récit
surgit le souvenir d’un autre homme en particulier, qui joua un rôle capital et pesa de
manière indélébile sur son destin : «le tueur qui lui redonna la vie». Un homme, au passé
lourd de crimes dont Emanuel fut témoin et rescapé, qui le sauva pourtant, dont il ignore 
la motivation de l’acte, auquel il pense souvent et qu’il souhaiterait ardemment un jour
retrouver pour le remercier et élucider des questions jusqu’aujourd’hui sans réponse.
C’est ce soir-là que j’ai proposé à Emmanuel l’idée de l’accompagner dans le cadre d’un
documentaire dans sa quête pour retrouver ce bourreau qui fut son bon samaritain.
Il accepta d’emblée.
Nous accompagnerons Emmanuel dans le lieu-dit de Mugonéro et ses environs, qui furent
le théâtre de massacres qui se sont déroulés entre avril et juillet 1994, auxquels il survécut.
Ce documentaire se présentera, pour partie, sous la forme d’une enquête policière et en
empruntera quelques une des méthodes : le retour sur la scène du crime, le recueil des
indices, des preuves, les témoignages des différents protagonistes encore vivants, acteurs
ou victimes, dont certains sont exilés, les personnes qui ont connu le professeur comme
ami, comme collègue, qui l’ont côtoyé pendant les évènements ou qui firent partie de sa
milice; toutes les informations qui permettront de saisir le contexte, de cerner la
personnalité du criminel et de le localiser.
Ce criminel, un Hutu, âgé aujourd’hui de 52 ans. Son nom : Ezéchias Mujyemangango.
Il exerçait en 1994 la fonction de professeur au collège d’Ishya où fut scolarisé Emmanuel,
son élève. La dernière information que nous ayons le localise quelque part au Cameroun,
sans autre précision.";s:14:"representation";s:2113:"
Note de production

Même si le génocide rwandais, survenu en 1994, est un drame déjà très documenté, on ne produira jamais assez d’éléments sur ce sujet (conférences, articles, livres, reportages, films, etc…) pour ausculter l’indicible. Le documentaire, Le tueur qui me redonna la vie, contribuera pour sa part, à travers le double portait d’un survivant et d’un bourreau, à éclairer ces recoins obscurs où l’humanité a abdiqué face à la bestialité. 
Avec ce projet de film, situé plus de 25 ans après les faits, loin dans le temps et si près - la blessure reste à vif - de la tragédie qui a frappé majoritairement la communauté tutsi et certains hutu, Mama Keïta nous offre le portrait d’un homme au parcours très singulier qui tend un miroir à notre humanité.            De fait, à travers Emmanuel, Mama Keita soulève ici des questions existentielles très profondes portant sur les traumatismes qui dépassent l’entendement, la résilience et ses limites, la capacité de pardon et le travail de mémoire.

Dès que Mama Keïta m’a parlé de ce projet de documentaire, j’ai aussitôt accepté de l’accompagner dans cette aventure. D’abord parce que j’apprécie son travail de cinéaste et que je sais combien les auteurs-réalisateurs de fictions sont en général excellents lorsqu’ils s’emparent du cinéma du réel.

C’est le rapport filmeur-filmé qui fait la qualité d’un portrait documentaire : la complicité, la tension, le chemin parcouru, non seulement du sujet vers le cinéaste et vice versa, mais des deux vers le film. Ici, la distance géographique et temporelle, alliée à la proximité et à la confiance que Mama Keïta a su tisser avec Emmanuel, constituent les ingrédients très prometteurs d’un dialogue cinématographique passionnant. 

Avec Le tueur qui me redonna la vie, le spectateur aura le sentiment de participer en direct à la lutte d’un homme pour comprendre la signification profonde de sa propre existence car pour Emmanuel, il doit y avoir une raison à sa survie, celle-ci doit être port";s:21:"representation_upload";s:21:"2021/1623831741_1.pdf";s:16:"contracts_upload";s:0:"";s:15:"artistic_upload";s:0:"";s:13:"visual_upload";s:0:"";s:12:"project_link";s:0:"";s:16:"project_password";s:0:"";s:8:"synopsis";s:0:"";s:13:"projectBudget";s:6:"276000";s:13:"financialPlan";s:0:"";s:12:"totalSecured";s:6:"144000";s:12:"totalApplied";s:6:"131000";s:11:"totalPening";s:1:"0";s:13:"BudgetDeficit";s:6:"132000";s:10:"budgetFile";s:0:"";s:9:"proofFile";s:0:"";s:13:"contractProof";s:0:"";s:12:"ackStatement";s:0:"";s:11:"submittedBy";s:11:"Mama KEÏTA";s:12:"project_role";s:9:"filmmaker";s:10:"filmmanker";s:0:"";s:8:"producer";s:0:"";s:20:"project_co_ordinator";s:0:"";s:13:"project_role2";s:0:"";s:16:"project_category";s:0:"";s:13:"project_brief";s:0:"";s:16:"project_timeline";s:1:"0";s:16:"project_describe";s:0:"";s:12:"organisation";s:0:"";s:20:"explain_organisation";s:0:"";s:15:"briefly_explain";s:0:"";s:14:"socio_economic";s:0:"";s:10:"video_link";s:0:"";s:16:"description_link";s:0:"";s:20:"description_password";s:0:"";s:15:"proposal_upload";s:0:"";s:10:"project_co";s:1:"0";s:8:"complete";s:1:"1";s:6:"status";s:1:"1";s:5:"addon";s:19:"2021-06-27 22:57:32";s:5:"award";s:1:"0";}}s:13:"result_object";a:71:{i:0;O:8:"stdClass":54:{s:2:"id";s:1:"4";s:8:"grant_id";s:2:"18";s:7:"user_id";s:1:"6";s:4:"name";s:16:"APRÈS LE RETOUR";s:6:"p_date";s:2:"60";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:8:"e_length";s:3:"60+";s:7:"logline";s:210:"Après avoir tenté en vain de rejoindre l’Europe par la méditerranée, Cris-Israel, un jeune homme de 30 ans, revient en Côte d’Ivoire son pays, où il entame un combat ardu pour sa réinsertion sociale.";s:15:"story_structure";s:1927:"Début 2019.

As a daughter and filmmaker, Asmae fuses personal and national history as she reflects on the 1981 Bread R";s:15:"story_structure";s:2033:"It’s summertime and young Moroccan director Asmae goes to her parents’ place in Casablanca to help them move out. Back in her family house, she starts to sort out all the objects of her childhood. 
At some point, she sees an upsetting photograph: children smiling in a kindergarten playground. On the edge of the frame there is a little girl sitting on a bench, looking shyly at the camera. 

This picture is the only image of her childhood, the only memory her mother could give to her. But Asmae is convinced that she’s not the child on this picture. Hoping to make her parents talk, Asmae introduces her camera and plays with this intimate incident to talk about other memories that she doesn’t trust either. This photo, a sensitive subject, becomes the starting point of an investigation during which the director questions all the little lies told by her family: is her mother saying the truth about the picture ? Has her father really built with his own hands the Lion of Ifrane ? Does her grandmother say the truth about Asmae’s job and why does she prefer to tell everyone that she’s a journalist? 

Behind the walls of the house, there is also the neighborhood. And Asmae remembers…
The local politician, Sir Abdelkader: is he the generous man offering hammam, meat and plums to the neighborhood or a corrupt politician ? 
Little by little, Asmae explores the memory of her own people - either real or surreal - together with the memory of her neighborhood and country. 

What’s real in this reconstructed story made out of fragmented childhood memories ? 
As the lies grow bigger, the director discovers something strange. She discovers a cemetery not far from their home and the strange story of bodies that disappeared 38 years before: the “Bread Riot”. The story of a popular uprising, violently repressed in that neighborhood during Hassan II Dark Years.  
Surrounded by her parents and neighbors, Asmae creates links between her childhood photo and the Bread Riot on June 20th 1981. 

";s:22:"characters_description";s:1997:"Ouarda El Moudir	

Ouarda is Asmae’s model since her childhood. She was always the one hiding secrets to better protect the family. Mystery and lies are for her a way to better preserve family’s balance and to comfort her daughter. Grounded in the present and knowing that the quest for truth doesn’t really exist, she invents stories against her will and prefers to avoid political subjects. First daughter-in-law to enter the El Moudir family circle, she suffered from her mother in law’s rejection and from her strict principles. With Asmae, talks are always very lively even though they are very close. If she starts refusing to talk about her lies, she finally agrees to make the film when she discovers that she won’t be the only one to do so. She decided to move out from Casablanca to go live in the countryside around Salé.

Asmae El Moudir	
			
Asmae’s character is a mix between the twelve years old girl she was, spontaneous and innocent, embodied in the film by her miniature character, and the 30 years old woman she is today: a rebel director who chooses to look for truth whatever it costs. Youngest daughter in the family, Asmae is very close from her parents and grandmother. Searching for traces of her past and identity, she gathers little family history with big national history. She decides to use all her energy to understand lies, even if this sometimes means fighting with your loved ones.

Mohammed El Moudir
Mohammed is his daughter’s hero. Tender, he always uses irony and emphasizes his stories to better shine before his daughter’s eyes. He is a mason and restored almost all the walls of his neighborhood in Casablanca, except his own walls. In contrast to his wife, he lives in the past and likes words better than action. 

Zahara 

Zahara is Asmae’s grandmother. She’s a 87 years old woman who was always very mysterious about her origins. 
She lived a difficult life and a very poor childhood. Married when she was very young.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2027:"After some years abroad, I return to the heart of the family home and neighbourhood of Casablanca where I grew up, to help my parents move out. Leaving this neighborhood filled with historical events in order to go live far from city center is a new start for my parents. And it’s a good way for me to introduce my camera in the house and question them about the mysterious photo of my childhood to better find the truth behind it. 

The importance of memory in my work

This discovery of the Bread Riot brings back a memory: when I’m a little girl, I remember my mother telling me the most traumatising day of her life. On a Saturday morning in Casablanca, military bullets are flying everywhere and take almost her life and my big brother Ahmed’s life. Why did she never tell me the details and reasons of this riot? I’m pissed at my parents because they kept me in the dark and told me nothing about this event that they’ve been through personally.

While I’m watching the news, I’m particularly moved by the portraits of the disappeared ones, hold by the parents to the camera. One of them especially catches my attention: a woman with a sad look holds with both hands a black and white portrait of a gracious young lady. Her long black hair, her thin face and her black eyes give her a serious look. Her name is Fatima. This twelve years old girl died on June 20th 1981 in the very same streets where I was playing carelessly during my youth. 
The Image’s issue

The image’s issue seems to be an appropriate and relevant way to talk about my country. From Bread Riot there is only one photo that survived through all these years. A black and white picture with people dead on the streets. All the others were destroyed in order to better organize official speech. There are no national archives in Morocco. All the existing documents were neglected or retrieved by Institutions that belong to the Royal Cabinet, still under political control.

Dans ce périple, nous allons rencontrer des chanteurs juifs originaires du Maroc et provenant de trois pays différents, ce qui constitue trois styles musicaux distincts.

C’est un parcours qui passe par l’Espagne, l’Israël et le Maroc, et dont le fil conducteur est la musique juive, interprétée par des Juifs d’origine marocaine. 
Le film est une manière de rendre hommage à une grande partie de l’histoire du Maroc qui s’est rétrécit en quelques ruelles étroites connues comme « Mellahs ».
Je vais essayer de réinstaurer ces liens historiques, à travers notamment la musique juive, cette musique qui a favorisé, au long de plus de deux mille cinq cents ans, le dialogue culturel entre les différentes composantes de la société marocaine, dont la majorité ont déjà abandonné le Maroc pour s’installer en Israël, mais tout en gardant présents les principales caractéristiques qui identifient la culture marocaine, surtout au niveau du chant.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:2111:"LALA TAMAR
Dans l’une des ruelles de Jaffa, qui me rappellent celles de Fès, je retrouve la chanteuse Tamar Bloch Amar, connue par Lala Tamar, avec une Djellaba multicolore reflétant ses origines marocaines.

Nous prenons ses ruelles pour nous diriger vers son appartement qui est en réalité un studio. Une fois arrivés, des meubles en bois décorant l’entrée du studio sautent aux yeux, en plus d’un élégant piano et de tissus marocains multicolores ornant les murs, ainsi qu’un ordinateur posé sur une table en bois. Tout cela m’a fait oublier les distances qui me séparent du Maroc, et m’a donné la sensation de chaleur familiale.
Elle m’a préparé du thé et en ce moment, elle a commencé à chantonner les mélodies de sa chanson la plus connue en Haketia. Celle-ci est bien la chanson que j’aime le plus. 
Je l’ai écouté jusqu’à la fin et puis je lui ai demandé de m’expliquer ses paroles, elle m’a dit qu’il s’agit d’une histoire d’amour vécue à Tétouan, au nord du Maroc…

Elle me parle de l’amour qu’elle a pour la Haketia grâce notamment à ses origines, puisque sa mère est née au Maroc.
Je l’interrompe, pourquoi la langue de la Haketia, tandis qu’il existe plusieurs chanteurs juifs qui ont choisi de chanter en anglais ou tout simplement en hébreu, ce qui aide à viser un grand public…

MOR KARBASI
Lors de notre promenade, nous écoutons une voix poétique divine (nous saurons par la suite que c’est la voix de l’héroïne de notre deuxième voyage- Mor Karbasi). Peu après, Mor Karbasi me dit qu’à chaque fois qu’elle visite ce quartier ancien, elle sent qu’il manque de quelque chose de précieux, certaines choses que l’Espagne aurait perdues. C’est un sentiment vague certes, mais je suis en mesure de le sentir, sentir que la composante culturelle manque quelque part, sentir le vide et l’absence…
Elle réplique que la musique chantée par les personnes déplacées de Grenade vers l’Afrique du nord ou les réfugiés juifs résidant en Grenade est chargée de nostalgie et du désir.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1658:"           Pour que le film soit présenté sous une forme provisoire et afin que ceci nous guide lors de l’étape de préparation, je propose que sa construction se base sur trois saisons ou séquences-mouvements. Ce schéma général peut être modifiable lors la rédaction, tournage ou montage, et ce en se basant sur les différentes rencontres menées avec les trois protagonistes du film ou encore sur les rencontres de ces derniers avec des personnages secondaires, c’est ainsi que le parcours général du voyage sera conçu.

Il est possible de regrouper les séquences du film en trois mouvements/voyages vers :

L’Israël ;

L’Espagne ;

Le Maroc.

Qu’on peut traduire ou expliquer à travers :

La quête des chanteurs juifs originaires du Maroc et installés en Israël.
Le voyage de la Grenade nous a permis de découvrir de près la musique gharnatie et la poésie séfarade, ainsi que la façon dont elles ont pu traduire l’essence de l’exode depuis Grenade vers le Maroc. C’est un style musical qui se caractérise par sa mélancolie et tristesse.
 Le film ne représente pas la transmigration de façon négative, bien qu’à l’époque, elle a toujours été liée aux malheurs et aux tristesses. Au contraire, il l’a tracé comme étant un élément positif d’un point de vue musical, puisqu’il a contribué à l’enrichissement du répertoire musical juif et à son métissage avec la culture du nord du Maroc, c’est exactement ce qui apparait dans la troisième partie relative au troisième voyage traitant du Maroc. 
Le film adopte la méthode du cinéma direct en termes de réalisation.

Les miliciens du Mouvement de libération du Congo (MLC), de Jean-Pierre Bemba qui ont prêté main forte, se sont livrés, sans retenue et avec enthousiasme, à des actes d’exactions. Cette période a été la plus sombre que l'on ne puisse imaginer. Les armes ont circulé, les larmes ont coulé, des vies ont été perdues et des crimes commis.

";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2066:"“I Londo awe”(titre provisoire du film) sera un docu-fiction de 75 min. Nous ferons une reconstitution de certaines scènes vécues, qui sont marquant de leur histoire, afin de montrer par quoi elles sont passées. Caméra à la main pour des scènes vivantes et en mouvement, caméra fixes sur pied pour des interviews, nous allons habiller certaines de nos images par des voix off de nos personnages dans certaines situations dans le but de les protéger et ne pas les exposer. 

Nous visons pour “I Londo awe” à faire vivre au spectateur les mêmes émotions que nos personnages, à l'immerger dans son monde et à s'attacher à lui au fil de l'histoire. Visuellement, rien ne vaut d'être dans un film avec le personnage. C'est ce sentiment que nous aimerions le plus transmettre au spectateur. Pour cela, nous utiliserons les gros plans sur nos personnages principaux pendant leur journée, leurs activités quotidiennes pour entrer dans leur monde. Pour cela, nous nous inspirons du film Arbre Sans Fruit de Aïcha Macky dont nous avons étudié la cinématographie. Ce langage cinématographique intime permet aux spectateurs d’accompagner les personnages dans leur mouvement quotidien, de suivre l'évolution de leur histoire en temps réel en totalité. Lorsque les sujets arrivent à de nouvelles destinations, notre caméra se rapproche au plus près, après avoir établi les plans d’ensemble. Ces gros plans extrêmes relient le spectateur aux émotions de nos sujets, à leur voyage intérieur. 
Nous savons ce que l'on ressent lorsqu'on est méprisé ou que l'on est perçu comme quelqu'un de moins capable, qui ne sert plus à rien.

Cette sensibilité ne peut pas être truquée ou créée, c'est quelque chose qui est là et qui va être révélé à l'écran de manière subtile.

Ce premier épisode  intitulé « de l’Indépendance au crise de 1991 », va parler de l’indépendance  en 1960 , du premier président Philibert Tsiranana , et de la naissance même de la nation Malagasy . Ce président  désigné par la France Coloniale sera demis de ses fonctions après un soulèvement populaire en1972.

Un évènement conduisant à la désignation du «  Président Rouge » l’Amiral Didier Ratsiraka et à ses 23 ans au pouvoir de la République Malgache.

Didier Ratsiraka est un président Communiste, ami de François Mitterrand et Mercenaire Robert Denard. Il est aussi très proche du pouvoir Communiste Chinois, du Kremlin de Cuba de Castro, ainsi que de la Lybie de Khadafi qui est son ami fidèle. De 1975 a 1991 commence la construction Massif de logements sociaux, d’Universités et d’infrastructures Routiers à Madagascar. Ratsiraka défend aussi est aussi la cause Sud Africaine et de l’ANC pendant l’Apartheid.  Les antennes radio de l’ANC ont pu émettre depuis Madagascar sur les ondes Hertzienne et les rumeurs sur sa rencontre avec le Président  Frederik De Klerk pour la Libération de Nelson Mandela lui ont valu le respect du monde entier. Président engagé parmi « les Non alignés de Bandung », », il sera chassé du pouvoir  en 1991, par une révolte sanglant. et un pouvoir démocratique verra le jour mais ?

Ce jeune poète représente la jeunesse malgache d'aujourd'hui qui, à travers sa vie d'artiste et de vagabond à une certaine point de vue sur son existence et une certaine réalité dans sa survie. Il vit au jour le jour et essaye de comprendre ce qui se passe dans son Pays. C’est un jeune homme qui à gouté à plusieurs vies,  et qui a jonglée entre universitaire, travailleur sociaux, élève policier ,etc…puis qui à sombré petit à petit dans la misère la plus totale. Sa seule échappatoire sera le texte, sa poésie, pour le transporter dans un rêve où il y a un pays libre et surtout un pays bon à vivre. Mais ce n’est que Utopie.
Le Voix OFF représente la Nation Malgasy. Telle en agonie sur un lit de mort cette nation qui a 61, s'interroge encore sur sa raison d'être et fait une introspection dans sa personne.

Parfois même cette voix off « La Nation » s’essaye a des sarcasme sur sa vie et sur ses dérives par rapport à d’autre nation qu’il admire, dans une divagation totalement irréel.

Ces divorces sont très souvent occasionnés par des divergences racistes, ethniques, religieuses, culturelles, linguistiques, claniques, politique ou éducationnelles. La  Guinée dans sa Région forestière, est l’habitat actuel des ethnies Kpèlè et Konia parmi tant d’autre. Tous anciennement animistes pendant des siècles, ces ethnies sont aujourd’hui à la croisé des religions monothéistes dont les Kpèlè majoritairement chrétien ainsi que les Konia majoritairement musulman.

Ces deux ethnies entretiennent aujourd’hui un climat de haine démesuré dont on ignore encore les raisons. Cette haine qui se manifeste par le repli identitaire et la méfiance entre eux, a occasionné une forte opposition contre l’union conjugale de Gervais HABA jeune cinéaste âgé de 32 ans, né de l’ethnie Kpèlè et Mariam SACKO jeune fille de 27 ans, diplômée en gestion touristique licence (3), née de l’ethnie Konia. 

Mais quelles  peuvent bien être les raisons de cette opposition ? Qu’elles peuvent être les difficultés rencontrées par ces deux amoureux alors qu’ils ont déjà fait un enfant qui coure vers ses deux ans ? Comment parviendront-ils à vivre leur véritable histoire d’amour déjà fortement controversée par le père de Mariam SACKO?
A travers les étapes préparatoires de ce mariage incertain, on va essayer de faire ressortir les différents conflits dans la rencontre des deux familles, les responsables religieux, les sages des différents peuples et quelques témoins qui vivent les mêmes réalités qu’ils empruntent déjà, afin d’interpeler les acteurs de  ses différentes rancœurs qui favorisent chaque fois un climat de désastres.

La narration s’élaborera dans les rencontres avec mes personnages dont la vie est liée à l’existence des évènements de dislocations qui ont marqué mon peuple ces dernières décennies.

Je compte sur leur spontanéité pour dynamiser la dramaturgie du récit lorsque nos discussions seront  intenses car je n’ai pas non plus évoqué avec eux ma propre histoire que je suis entrain de vivre déjà.  

Le rythme que je donnerai à nos entretiens amènera sans doute des silences qui exprimeront autant que les paroles. J’utiliserai une image assez large quand nos discussions seront seulement informatives. Les gros plans seront utilisés lorsque  nos échanges seront plus émotionnels. 
La plus part des scènes se dérouleront en extérieur, dans les lieux où ils ont vécu les évènements historiques qu’ils nous narrent. Ces décors seront choisis en fonction de leur esthétisme, et de la charge historique, émotionnelle et dramaturgique qu’ils portent en eux. Je me ferai guider par l’orientation narrative à travers les démarches de prise de contact de mes personnages pour atteindre mon objectif.

Kinshasa. Capital of the D.R.Congo. I have been dreaming about this city for two decades from my home town of Goma, 1500 km away. If it fascinated me to the point of moving there at the end of 2013, it is largely because of the way its 18 million inhabitants conceive life. In Kinshasa, problems, crises and disasters are nothing more than trials, and the struggle of the population is to find a " way of not surrendering " to a given trial. Thus, "Nzonzing" (Developed resourcefulness), "sapology" (the cult of dress and elegance), "mabanga" (payable dedications), "matolo" (made-up begging), etc. are, among many others, ingenious ways of not giving in to institutionalized chaos. 

The background of this film will be the realities of the first 3 years of this regime, which was born of the first peaceful alternation of the presidency of the republic. Presented as "civilized," much hope was placed in this noble gesture that saw for the first time ever a sitting president (M. Kabila) hand over the baton of leadership to an elected president (M. Tshisekedi). 

The story will be bolstered by the character’s poetry - both savory and zany - with which Lordi, Andria, Patrick and Enoch perpetually reinvent their "way of not surrendering". 

The narrative structure will have 3 layers. 
- The 1st layer is that of 4 stories. One story per main character. Narratives that are so close together that they will make and unmake each other and, ultimately, turn into one and the same story. A portrait of the group. 
- The 2nd is that of a “stop and go” cycle choregraphy. A choregraphy that will fix the group’s career, the journey of each member and the movement of bodies’s occupation of space. 
- The last one is that of a two-part journey : A physical ride made by the four characters every day to survive and an interior journey which brings them to the evidence long denied.

";s:22:"characters_description";s:2019:"Kinshasa is divided into two physical parts. The city center and the "cité". The city center is inhabited by the rich and the "cité" by the poor. "Cité" is short for the part that was called the "cité indigène" in colonial times.  Today it is home to 80 percent of the population. Living conditions are precarious and the infrastructure is either dilapidated or non-existent. It is in this atypical universe that Andria, Lordi, Enoch and Patrick live. Four young men, funny, creative and dynamic. They are the main characters of this film. 

They are a group of itinerant comedians who, in addition to their basic work, are constantly looking for a project that will immediately improve their living conditions. 10 years have passed since they created their group and since they tried several projects, hoping that each of them would be the saving project. The passage of time was not a problem for them as long as they could survive with the little they earned and as long as they did not turn to banditry like many young people from the "cité". Working as a itinerant comedian has always been a kind of outlet for them. Once disguised for the need of this work, Andria, Lordi, Enoch and Patrick adopt a character of “superhero”. Nothing affects them anymore. On the other hand, since they became parents everything has changed. They now have to take care of their wife and children. Hence the immediate obligation of results. It is from the moment they question their way of perceiving their work that the action of this film begins. 

They constitute a group that, like the "Beatles", does not prevent the personality of each of them from unfolding.

- An idealist, Enoch firmly believes in the advent of success that will change his life. 
- Leader, Lordi takes care of his image even if it means hiding his problems
- Mature, Patrick, father of three children, no longer has time to dream
- Disillusioned and entangled in a bunch of problems since birth, Andria uses the group to keep believing.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:905:"The film NZONZING will use direct cinema techniques. The archives that will be used in it, will be initially introduced by the characters. The traditional media will be used to define the socio-political and economic realities of the place where the story takes place. 

The city of Kinshasa, which is a character in itself, will be filmed in such a way as to juxtapose its two physical parts. 

When edited, the images of the city centre will be dull and fast paced and those of the city will be vivid with a fast pace to allow for the easy deployment of each action. 

The sound will move beyond its status as an image confirmation element to come to the foreground in some scenes in a wide and fixed shot or in a sequence shot to define a cut. 

The music will be based on percussion. Its primary function will not be to accompany, highlight or propose emotions, it will play a part in itself.

After analyzing the budget, this company has committed to contribute first with an amount of 15773 Euros. In the meantime, Mr. Michael Dobbin and his team are studying the possibilities of mobilizing other funds in Canada and in the USA. 

About distribution. QUIET REVOLUTION PRODUCTIONS inc. has made an offer from its subsidiary CAPITAL MOTION PICTURE GROUP to distribute the film alongside the company MAZIWA MAKUU FILMS of Ms. DJIA MAMBU. 

In addition, the project NZONZING will be presented at this year's DURBAN FILMMART. We are counting on this opportunity to attract other partners capable of helping us to materialize this project. ";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:2008:"I met them for the first time one afternoon in December 2018 while I was sitting on the terrace of a bar on the edge of Nyangwe Avenue (not far from the downtown). Andria, Lordi, Enoch and Patrick appeared in front of me and made me laugh with the jokes they were telling with application and frenzy. Impressed, I found myself obliged to give them some money before returning home praising their courage and genius. Their "way not to surrender" seemed to me to be a good answer to the unemployment that affects seventy percent of the Congolese. 

Curiously, I couldn't forget them. Their grim faces, their big brightly colored glasses, their laughter, the color of their beards, their false bloated bellies, their looks of superheroes ... Thinking about it, I began to wonder about the durability of their work and the nature of their mask in this city where appearance is an important social indicator. 

When I saw them again, I learned that they were a group of four itinerant comedians, that they lived in the "city" but worked exclusively in the downtown. This means that in order to work they have to cross fifteen kilometres each day, both on the outward and return journey. Their basic work consists of grimacing their faces and wearing grotesque outfits before criss-crossing the downtown, its surroundings, its bars and terraces to tell jokes and funny stories to people they meet. Sometimes these people give them a little money. That money is their gain.

Andria, Lordi, Enoch and Patrick develop projects, both ambitious and daring, and carry them out. If one project does not produce the desired results, they get together to find another. In the meantime, while waiting for a new project to be executed, they continue their core work as itinerant comedians. This basic work is the only one that so far has helped them to support themselves and the people for whom they are responsible. 

These four men alone crystallize the fears and vicissitudes of a youth abandoned to its sad fate.";s:14:"representation";s:2008:"The noun "Nzonzing" is used in Kinshasa slang to mean a sideline or extra activity, whether or not it is related to a person's main activity. No other word carries the subject of this film better than this timeless, anodyne noun.  

The Nzonzing film file we submit to you is not just a file, it is the emanation of a filmmaking device that took several months to clarify and a trivialized social phenomenon that, in our opinion, best defines the local society in which we live.

In 2018 Moimi Wezam released his first film entitled ZERO. This 66-minute documentary is in itself a sort of tribute to the late Papa Wemba (the only Congolese musical artist, to date, certified gold record in the United States). When on April 24, 2016, in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Papa Wemba's unexpected death occurred, his dancer Benedicte Shutsha (who worked for him for fifteen years) was devastated. During his mourning, little by little, the idea of remixing the song ZERO of his late mentor became clear in his head. A perilous project whose objective was both to pay tribute to her former employer and to launch her singing career. The ups and downs of this adventure, Benedicte Shutsha's difficulties in finding her place as the heir to an African music icon and the fact that this project could help her mourn her loss served as the first hinges of the narrative for what became the film ZERO. 

A film with a steady pace whose first objective was to share with the audience the feeling of stagnation that plagued Benedicte during her mourning and the way she struggled to get rid of it. To this first choice was added a voice-over in the first person singular in which was concentrated an important emotional thickness. 

Moimi Wezam is proud of the result and of ZERO's journey. He believed in it, he wrote it and he mobilized the means to materialize it. With hindsight, he is convinced that if he had participated in the rewriting programs at the development stage and if he had succeeded in mobilizing more";s:21:"representation_upload";s:21:"2021/1620936639_1.jpg";s:16:"contracts_upload";s:0:"";s:15:"artistic_upload";s:0:"";s:13:"visual_upload";s:0:"";s:12:"project_link";s:0:"";s:16:"project_password";s:0:"";s:8:"synopsis";s:0:"";s:13:"projectBudget";s:6:"361050";s:13:"financialPlan";s:0:"";s:12:"totalSecured";s:5:"73843";s:12:"totalApplied";s:6:"287208";s:11:"totalPening";s:1:"0";s:13:"BudgetDeficit";s:6:"287207";s:10:"budgetFile";s:0:"";s:9:"proofFile";s:0:"";s:13:"contractProof";s:0:"";s:12:"ackStatement";s:0:"";s:11:"submittedBy";s:11:"MOIMI WEZAM";s:12:"project_role";s:9:"filmmaker";s:10:"filmmanker";s:0:"";s:8:"producer";s:0:"";s:20:"project_co_ordinator";s:0:"";s:13:"project_role2";s:0:"";s:16:"project_category";s:0:"";s:13:"project_brief";s:0:"";s:16:"project_timeline";s:1:"0";s:16:"project_describe";s:0:"";s:12:"organisation";s:0:"";s:20:"explain_organisation";s:0:"";s:15:"briefly_explain";s:0:"";s:14:"socio_economic";s:0:"";s:10:"video_link";s:0:"";s:16:"description_link";s:0:"";s:20:"description_password";s:0:"";s:15:"proposal_upload";s:0:"";s:10:"project_co";s:1:"0";s:8:"complete";s:1:"1";s:6:"status";s:1:"3";s:5:"addon";s:19:"2023-06-23 14:39:33";s:5:"award";s:1:"1";}i:10;O:8:"stdClass":54:{s:2:"id";s:3:"111";s:8:"grant_id";s:2:"18";s:7:"user_id";s:2:"90";s:4:"name";s:43:"the tragedy of forced child labour in Benin";s:6:"p_date";s:2:"52";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:8:"e_length";s:5:"21-59";s:7:"logline";s:52:"La tragédie du travail forcé des enfants au Bénin";s:15:"story_structure";s:1155:"Au Bénin, en dépit de toutes les dispositions qui ont été prises à travers les articles 13 de la constitution de 1990 du Bénin, l’article 166 du code du travail de 1998 et la loi de 2006 portant sur le transport des mineurs et la répression de la traitre des enfants par le gouvernement contre la maltraitance des enfants, force est de constater que plusieurs enfants de - (moins) de 13 ans et de - (moins) de 18 ans continuent de travailler à outrance et d’une manière dangereuse en tant qu’ « enfants placés », apprenti dans les ménages, dans les ateliers et sur les chantiers de constructions.

This time young people are fleeing various post-colonial challenges in their countries.

Abu Tew is a Fixer and a recruiter whose business is to recruit migrants and when he has a sufficient number of migrants, he employs the services of a captain to take his boat to Spain.

Bishop Harpe is a Catholic Bishop who buries migrants’ bodies that washes off from the Mediterranean, he also caters for migrants who are stuck in the city of Nouadhibou in Mauritania.

This documentary focuses mainly on the business angle. 

At first, Africans were subdued and inhumanely dragged to become slaves in a foreign land. Fast forward to centuries later, same Africans would do anything humanly possible to end up in same countries, same situations. From the onset, migration rode on the back of greedy men, mostly Chieftains, Kings and men of caliber who would sell their subjects in exchange for mirror, canon guns, gins, umbrellas’ etc.

In recent time, it’s still the same, fixers would transport 120 people on an 80 people capacity boat just to make more money from one trip. But so as not to derail, we will be focusing on why this activity despite how dangerous it is has grown over the years and for where there is a way, there is a will. The way in this case is the first few minutes of the documentary which touches on involuntary migration, this translates to the slave trade era. Due to minimal available footages, we will be depicting the era with 2D illustrations. The illustrations will show the gruesome movement of Africans (slaves) through this route despite how dangerous it was, and still is. 

Cornerstone Eyanem, we will see the plights of slsves through the eyes of a Tour Guide at the Badagry slave museum (Point of No Return) with a couple of students on Excursion 

On the other part of my project, Captain Abou, a Mauritanian fixer/clandestine will take us through a journey of this deadly routes which migrants ply. I intend to see the migrants through the eyes of the fixer, thereby revealing their desperation and reason to travel out of Africa not minding the dangers of the Desert & the Mediterranean and also not minding how much they will spend to get to their destination, if they will ever get there.
In this part of the project, I intend to come up close and personal.";s:14:"representation";s:1364:"BUSINESS AS USUAL was birthed out of deep concern for the massive loss of lives in the Mediterranean.

A lot of stories have been told about Migration, mostly from the migration point of view or the migrant’s point of view, it’s rare to have a Migration story from the business point of view, Business As Usual as the title implies takes a critical look at how money changes hands from the migrant to the clandestine. It also juxtaposes involuntary migration during the slave trade era with the mass voluntary migration in recent times using money as a yardstick. It seeks to reveal the intentions of the clandestine, are they helping, are they genuine or are they there to make their money without minding if lives are lost or not, why do they overload the boats etc., Business as usual will seek to answer these questions.

The whole idea is to highlight the injustice meted out at slaves during the slave trade era and comparing it with the illegal migration of today through the Mediterranean, 'Imagine seeing a rusted Canon Gun on the floor at the Badagry Slave Museum and been told that the piece of metal was used in exchange for 60 able bodied and healthy people'

Business as Usual is an observational film but not in its entirety. The style of the documentary is poetic and cinematic and as the theme is on migration, which connotes movement.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:1978:"The female body has been many things and nothing through time. She has been bruised, battered, covered up, opened up, cut open. She has been trimmed, watered, pruned like a garden, she has been nourished like a fattened cow; she has flourished and has also withered away. 

This film will be a fascinating combination of archival materials showcasing the culture and practices of old as well as convincing interviews from scholars and emotional cinematography following the lives of our primary character; Lynda Okonkwo.

The beginning of the documentary will feature conceptualization; what is fat? What is beauty? Here, the scholars will take us on a journey through time from pre-colonial Nigeriansocieties and cultures through till modern times to give us a holistic understanding of African cultures surrounding beauty, fat, and the female body.

Next, we will follow the true-life story of our main character, Lyda Okonkwo, backing it up with the voices of selected women, to get their personal experiences of how cultural preferences of beauty have affected their life choices.
What will follow will be the reality of their life choices and how they have been living with these choices especially dealing with peer pressure, body shaming, and the evolving cultural perception of beauty. We will also hear from them, the limits they are going to readjust or reaffirm their bodies. Here, together with the personal experiences, interviews of industry professionals from clinical psychologists to gym instructors, will give us insights into body dysmorphic disorder, the age of digital beauty, the effects of cultural preference and peer pressures on women as it relates to their bodies.

The documentary will end in what I call, the Reclamation. Here, all the elements of the documentary will come together like a crescendo in a symphony. Our characters will talk about their future in relation to their bodies, self-esteem, and their understanding of happiness.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:721:"The documentary will be told through the eyes of Lynda Okonkwo. Lynda has a smile that can light up any room and it doesn’t take much to get a tear to drop from her eyes, perhaps that’s what makes her a terrific actor. She is a 120kg, 6ft, fair-skinned goddess, someone the film industry considers “too fat to fit into some roles”. 
For one in the spotlight, her body is constantly on display and opportunities to shine often evade her, and the little that fall on her laps are ladled with stereotype and body shaming. 
Underneath the wide smile and bubbling personality, is a girl who wishes people can see past the number on the scale and accept her for who she is; a brilliant actor with a beautiful smile.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1912:"The desired tone and visual representation of the subject matter are going to be tailored to resonate with and be reflective of the primary target audience; women. The story is character-driven and the subject matter will be explored through the life of our primary character. Interviews from learned fellows on different aspects of the subject matter will also feed into the narrative.

Each interview will be framed in a way that the locations become characters in the story. The locations will play an integral part in strengthening the narrative flow.
Beauty lighting will form the basis of the lighting design of this documentary. The lighting will tell a story; one of freedom and acceptance. The lighting will be flattery and complementary, concealing nothing. However, if a character being interviewed insists on anonymity, we will explore the use of silhouette and light shaping to keep the character hidden. We will go a step further in distorting the voice, not to a level where it will be inaudible but comfortable for the character to express herself.

The sound accompanying the story being told will be in layers. The documentary will open with a poem, glorifying the female body and the struggles it has endured over time. This poem will be accompanied by compelling images to lure the audience into the world they are about to experience. The emotional beats of the story will be accompanied by melancholy music to reel the audience in. Other explorative parts of the documentary will be complemented by soulful, alternative RnB.

The documentary will be made up of interviews, re-enactments, archival videos, and pictures much for the visual appeal of the audience. Because of the unavailability of certain footage, there will be a re-enactment of scenes by professional actors. The actor’s performance, however, will be as realistic as possible, in line with the flow of the story.

This version of the story is told from the point of view of the colonizer.
The space for the struggle for the liberation of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde occurred in the forests and savannas of Guinea Bissau. According to the people's aspiration, Amílcar Cabral, leader of the armed struggle and of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde - PAIGC- and ideologue of the independence of the two countries, considers extending the armed struggle to the islands of Cape Verde.
To this end, it begins to mobilize Cape Verdeans scattered throughout the diaspora and forms a group of 31 young people, mostly students, including Pedro Pires, Júlio de Carvalho, Maria Ilidia, and Agnelo Dantas, who decide to embark on an adventure in order to participate in the armed liberation struggle in Cape Verde.
These young people are then sent to Cuba, where they live in complete hiding, and for two years on the island, 1965/67 are subjected to intense military training, with hard hours of guerrilla and artillery training.
With the murder of Che Guevara, the strategy changed and the group ended up not landing in Cape Verde. But, they realized that they could contribute to the liberation of Cape Verde, participating actively in the struggle in Guinea Bissau. Later on, these selfless Creole guerrillas formed the Cape Verdean nation and became influential figures in the country's political life.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1694:"Today, Pedro Pires is the president of Instituto Pedro Pires, an important institution in Cape Verde that promotes leadership training. He was the leader of the Cuba group and even became President of Cape Verde. He is a charismatic figure and considered a historical commander of the national liberation struggle.
Commander Júlio de Carvalho is nowadays a businessman in the trade. He was former Minister of Defense, in the early years of independence he lived in Guinea Bissau and was very dear to the Guinean population and Cubans. At the time of the mobilization, he was studying Chemical Engineering, in Coimbra. He fled Portugal because he had heard that Amílcar Cabral was going to be in Paris. 
Commander Agnelo Dantas, lives the peaceful life of a retired state military officer. He was the youngest of the group, part of Cape Verde at the age of 17, full of revolutionary ideas and to avoid Portuguese military service. His dream was to fight to expel the colonizer from his beloved homeland. After the fight, he was the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Cape Verde.
Maria Ilidia, currently lives in Portugal. She was the only woman in the group. Early on, she begins to realize the differences created by colonialism. It was in the middle of World War II and troops were stationed on the island where she lived, but the Portuguese soldiers and the Cape Verdean soldiers were separated, even the food was different. At the same time she sees her father being beaten and imprisoned, she grows up to fear who had white skin.
In “Nós, Povo das Ilhas” what we are going to do is to enter the intricacies of this bold and daring operation, but little known and publicized.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1979:"How to tell an episode of a country's official history? How to film emblematic and influential figures from Cape Verde, detaching us from the repeated journalistic narratives that build a cold heroic discourse?
We decided to embark on the adventure of telling this episode, using two central elements: the interviews and the archive. When making the teaser we realized that our characters are people very used to the formal interview; and for that reason, when analyzing this material later, we decided that the interviews of the film would be made from a more intimate look. 
We want to interview these characters in their homes, or on the symbolic stages of the war and the early years of independence (today empty spaces and many of them abandoned). Taking these characters to their center, it is a way to return to the core of emotional and emotional memory. We believe that we will reach these non-places of memory, where the characters can question themselves and make themselves known in another way.
To guide this narrative within more personal and intimate space, director Elson Santos will be the narrator that will introduce the “voice” of Cape Verdean youth, who inquires about their past. 
This questioning from a personal perspective will lead the viewer to follow Elson, not only during the interviews with the characters but also in the relentless search for archival material to support this story.
The archival material, which is found only outside Cape Verde (in Portugal, France, and Cuba). The fact that it is so difficult to access the historical memory of a country, is a problem common to all African youth, it will then be an issue that will accompany this archive research. This essayistic and reflective tone will accompany the entire film, as a way of deconstructing the heroic propaganda narratives.

Visually, the film navigates between mystical and surrealistic night scenes, punctuated by the appalling tales of children and the banality of their busy daily life. We plan to explore magical realism in this documentary to enhance our artistic creation.
Magical realism is an artistic current which "intends to offer a vision of reality renewed and broadened by taking into consideration the part of the strangeness, irrationality or mystery that it conceals. The story and the characters are anchored in reality, but the author introduces a magical or fantastic element that is not questioned in the fiction  ". Magical realism has inspired directors like Akira Kurosawa (dreams) Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie from Montmartre) or Benh Zeitlin (The beasts of the sourthern wild). We didn’t find so much references in documentary, but I guess if only we push forward the research, we might be able to find some.So, when asked how to transpose these elements of magical realism to this documentary project, we thought about observing nature and using different elements, namely air, water or even earth. Our reference in the matter would be the films by Andrei Tarkovsky the mirror and the Stalker. Films through which these elements play an important role, bringing a touch that is simultaneously surreal, magical, hypnotic and enigmatic. In this project, we intend to add to these elements, a discourse and a poetic capture of images through long static takes.
Thus,the rhythm will sometimes be frenzied to emphasize the dynamism of children always in perpetual motion, sometimes posed, poetic and contemplative to represent the environment in which they live, a frozen space-time. In Kolofata, the barrier between the past, the present and the future becomes very porous. The village looks like so many other Cameroonian villages to those which already existed 50 years; 100 years ago.

An unforgiving sun, a parched earth, a high mortality rate among youngsters and a failed economy have left the village desolate. A place where women are rarely allowed to have an active role in public. A place known for sectarian turbulence between Copts and Muslims, in which Copts are killed and driven out of their homes for their faith, among attacks on churches. Disenfranchised Coptic girls rebel by forming an all-female street theater troupe. MONIKA, a girl with a jaundiced tomboyish voice dreams to be a famous singer. MAGDA, the young leader of the group dreams to study theater and be a theater director, in a place that lacks even the primary education. MARINA, a clueless girl suffers domestic violence and epileptic seizures. MERIEM, alongside her seven girls’ siblings, carries the shame of not having a brother in the family. HEIDI, dreams to be a ballet dancer but what does that mean to her illiterate parents? The girls resist the classical roles they are destined for. They role-play as women, boys, men and trees. They are at that age where they can be anything they imagine to be. Their chemistry, their camaraderie and their bond seduce us into a world of their own. They sing, dance and run around performing in the allies, chanting folk songs, contemplating their future and criticizing how their conservative culture dictates their behavior. Their actions confuse their families, challenging the villagers, priests and the camera. Their unawareness of their own limitations pushes the boundaries of theatre and film.
All of them are confronted by prejudice and a deeply misogynistic climate. Their activities come with a lot of risk-taking. The conservative priests ask the Coptic people not to participate or attend the girls’ performance. They are not that welcomed in the churches. They are harassed when performing in the allies with Muslim majority.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1933:"MONIKA
18-year-old MONICA, with a grand tattoo of the Virgin Mary on her right arm, stands out from the group with her tomboyish attitude and masculine voice. What makes it even harder is the misunderstanding she often encounters, the people who insult her, mock her voice and instantly judge him. Villagers call her (a dude) and (a freak) and she was subjected to bullying and mockery for years. Many ask her to make an operation to remedy her coarse voice. However, she loves to sing. She creates her own self-defense mechanism. A mixture of showing off, lying to herself, and lying to others.
MAGDA
21-year-old MAGDA is the troupe’s young leader with an aura of wisdom, a face full of acne, stubborn eyes and a charming smile. Magda’s conflict is her seeking of validation from her older and younger brothers. Magda’s dream is to study theater in the Theater Institute in Cairo.
MARINA
A 24-year-old MARINA holds sacred beliefs yet at the same time is needled by doubts and fears that she is unable to articulate. She does not trust herself. She does not see a future for herself. Her brother beats her regularly. She is observed at all times by everyone. She describes her condition as moving with chains around her feet. The weight of which, slows her down and wounds her.
MYRIAM
Myriam carries the shame of her family and her parents, having only a female progeny. It is a family of seven daughters. Girls mean a worse livelihood. Villagers prefer to have boys because they can depend on them in work and carrying on the family name and business.
HAIDI
HAIDY, is the troupe’s slender 17-year-old writer. She joins the troupe in spite of the reservation of her family and relatives, especially her priest uncle. Haidy practices theater every day. She dreams of becoming a ballet dancer and leaving her small village behind. She is playful and she has many secret love affairs through Facebook and social media. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2000:"We aim to enter the bubble of these girls’ world, chasing the wildness and elusiveness of being young. Their lightheartedness contrasts starkly with the harsh reality of the future they are making plans for. In this coming-of-age story, we focus on those girls, who emanate strength, resilience, intelligence, courage, and love for each other. A hybrid of documentary aesthetic and unscripted narrative, depicting real people in an insular rural community, in which nonprofessional actors play versions of their real-life selves. That will allow us to explore the border between tragedy and freedom, control and submission, true and false, limitation and power of cinema. An interpenetration of fiction into reality and of reality into fiction. The camera holds in the edges of its frame the fear and restrictions those girls refuse to acknowledge. It interacts with the girls self-images and stories, allowing their journey, both visually and narratively, to play with the audience own perception.
We develop those characters through intimate close-ups that portray their internal struggles, self-deception, and pressure of their future, confusion and conflict of faith.
This story packed with personal drama follows the girls as they go about their turbulent daily lives, leaving plenty of space for livestreams, telephone conversations, intimate video diaries where they show what’s going on in their lives, from their own perspective, and share their thoughts about it. The sectarian violence events are also told through the mobile phone videos and livestreams.
That reality is intertwined with the girls’ dreams, stories and myths. That reveals not only their psychological state but also have a route in universal “spiritual traditions” in myths and religion. For instance, the girls walking on water, which has a resonance in Christianity and in Ancient Egyptian religion. Another example is Myriam, who always dreams of flying.

ways. In Kenya for example, farming patterns have changed as most farmers depend on rain 
fend agriculture, the rivers, lakes and oceans are either shallower or fuller and the water is 
becoming warmer destroying marine life.
In the Northern part of Kenya, pastoralists are suffering. Their goats and cows have been dying 
in hordes whenever drought strikes provoking them to change tact and shift to keeping camels.
Pastoralists communities are now putting more emphasis on camel rearing or shifting from 
other livestock species to camels (A climate change resilience strategy) which are more drought 
resistant for milk and meat production. 
Unlike cows and goats, camels can go for up to two weeks without water and still have constant 
milk production. 
Herders who have shifted from cow rearing to camels are now selling twice as much milk as 
they used to sell before. Working with cooperatives enables women to spend more time with 
their families as well as do other businesses.

number only around 4,000. And only less than 5 people, all over the age of 70, can speak the ethnic group’s native language, Yakunte, fluently.

The Yaaku are believed to have migrated from Ethiopia to Kenya, where they settled in the Mukogodo forest, west of Mount Kenya, more than 100 years ago. They interacted with rendile and formed a tribe known as the Yaaku. The Yaaku, whose name means “hunting people,” kept bees and began trading with the Maasai, the country’s largest pastoral people. Eventually the Yaaku assimilated into Masai culture, adopting the Masai tongue over their own Cushitic language.

As the number of Yakunte speakers has dwindled, various efforts have been made to save the language. Yakunte speakers and a Dutch researcher wrote a Yakunte dictionary in 2004. Advocates of the people established the Yaaku People Association in 2003, dedicated to preserving its culture. Recently, according to a BBC report, a local school funded by the French Cultural Group is holding language classes twice a month for young Yaaku.

I have been part of this effort to preserve this language by featuring their culture and traditions  on a TV show that I produced called Foods Of Kenya. This however is not enough since it's only a feature.

I would love to produce a 60 min documentary, detailing this tribe's  livelihood, culture, songs  and tribe before it all gets extinct with the older generation. I believe that documenting this tribe in video will have more impact than even writing a dictionary with the languages,

The story structure will be following the life of a Yakunte speaking old man as he teaches children the tribe through, songs and dance, cultural beliefs, tradition and way of life.

1. The 3 Yakunte Speaking older generation. They appear through out the documentary wearing their traditional outfits and walking with a stick. they posses alot of knowledge about their culture but cannot share this with the younger generations due to language barrier even though they are from the same community.

2. 5 Yaaku children (boys and girls) who don't speak the language. appears at the start of the documentary with a modern look to emphasise on the lack of relation between them and the older generation. their look changes as the documentary progresses since they have started to learn the Yakunte tribe and are able to hold conversations in the tribe

The plan is to use the series as a tool to assist people at different levels of society to grapple with the big threat that the climate emergency presents to humanity, bio-diversity and sustainability of life as we know it in Southern Africa. 
 
Intertwining the stories of people who are living at the forefront of the changing climate in Southern Africa, we show how it is those least responsible for this crisis that are most adversely impacted. And in a region where every degree of warming will make a vast difference to how well future generations fare, the series tracks the journey of individuals and movements striving to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. Yet in this region, where the mineral energy complex has shaped the economy, as Naomi Klein would say, ‘This changes everything’.
 
While we draw on the knowledge of African climate scientists to break down the causes of the crisis, the thrust of the series is the eight unique but interwoven, character led storylines, taking place in Namibia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and South Africa. Concluding a year of research and development in communities where the combined effects of climate and social crisis are rapidly reshaping daily life, in each case the POV will be that of people leading the charge for a sustainable future. In this, we offer the gift of the collective wisdom of activists, youth and women’s leadership, and indigenous knowledge systems. While we focus on the most important climate justice priorities in Southern Africa at the moment – drought, food security, a just transition from fossil fuels, and making safe the air we breathe  - the central thread of HotSpot is questioning how we got here and how we navigate our way into a future where we live, consume and produce in a way that supports and regenerates the natural world that we depend on for survival.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:1992:"Madagascar: Theo Rakotovao is an internationally acclaimed musician from the Mikea people. When he hears that an Australian mining company aim to mine in his town, he becomes one of the leading faces of the opposition. 
 
Mozambique: Celia Macamo is an academic whose mission is to help restore the Mozambique coastline. Jacinta Laissone’s responsibility is to implement a new Climate Action Plan for the city of Xai Xai. Can these two mothers persuade enough people to get behind this life saving work? 
 
Zimbabwe: Admire Gwatidzo, a permaculture farmer and community coordinator grows food in abundance for over 15 years in food insecure and drought stricken Zimbabwe. Can he replicate his methods? 
 
Namibia: Ina-Maria Shikongo, a young mother of three, spearheads an international campaign against oil drilling in the delta. 
 
South Africa: From Soweto, to the courtroom to Parliament, Francina Nkosi, a mother of four living next to Medupi coal power plant, Alex Lenferna, the brainchild of the Green New Eskom campaign, and Promise Mbilo, an eco-feminist, enviro champion and a key applicant in a deadly air court case against the South African government, build a Just Transition movement from the bottom up. 
 
Kolisa Sinyana is a vivacious young oceanographer, whose self-confessed passion is communicating the science of climate change to ordinary people. But what does this mean for a young black woman in South Africa, one who has fought poverty and patriarchy to make her mark as a marine scientist, as she projects into a future that is less than certain?
 
LGBTIQ+ youth activists Raeesa Mohammed and Gabriel Klaasen are in different ends of the country, finding relief in climate activism. When they meet a unique friendship is born out of shared hopes and fears. There is an urgency in their  POV that is compelling both to young black audiences, and to older viewers who cannot help but feel complicit in creating the problems that the young will inherit.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2009:"Using a format of six TV-hour episodes, the series follows eight storylines each led by a set of connected characters from across Southern Africa, that have a specific motivation and something to achieve. Each of the storylines centre around a physical place – a town, a forest, a borehole, a mine – or a cause or right that people are defending or fighting for. Audiences must care about these characters, and empathise strongly with their mission, their survival, or success or failure in what they set out to do.

Style - Our interviews with the characters will be in situ, often outside or in the spaces the protagonists inhabit or work in. The style of filming will allow for intimate moments with the characters, in their home and personal life, using verité hand-held style of filmmaking. 

It is important that through the main storylines, clear information about the climate science is presented, and why urgent and dramatic shifts need to happen across the region.  The interwoven stories draw strongly on nature-based solutions, local knowledge and ideas, and eco-feminist thinking which helps shift our connection to the environment. We want people to understand that our natural environment is not just a resource to exploit, but to realise that the environment is us. How can we support that idea? 

Shots of nature - life giving forests, rivers, estuaries, wilderness, freshwater as a celebration, earth and soil that hold our food; and the power of nature to break, erode and cause devastation help us connect to the natural world. Each storyline holds a trace of the living world and that thread needs to be tangible in the visuals. 

Visual motifs – For each storyline, a parallel recurring visual motif mirrors this development over time. A natural element – be it a polluted river, a plot of farmed land, a section of coastline – is filmed over the production period presenting the growth, the decay, the loss, the filling up or emptying of that piece of environment.

For close to thirty years, asylum seekers from over fifteen countries in and beyond east Africa have called Kakuma their home. It is here that they have formed new communities, grown businesses, married, raised children and buried friends and family.

In our documentary Repatriation, we will follow Kenyan born and raised South Sudanese ‘refugee’ David Erjok. Unverified as a Kenyan citizen Erjok carries both Kenya and South Sudan heavy in his heart and like many, remains unsure what will his future holds.

The story picks up from Nairobi where Erjok currently undertakes his undergraduate studies at the Pan Africa Christian University. Just as he was growing accustomed to life in Nairobi, the coronavirus pandemic hit, limiting interactions with friends and family.  

Lonely and anxious, Erjok is keen to get back to Kakuma during the August break where he will discuss with his family their options, if at all.

Through this short but impactful cinematic film, Erjok will reveal the slow and painful erosion of asylum seeker’s rights worldwide.

Using Erjok’s poetry the film will conjure imagery of the countless lives of migrants lost at sea, children in detention centers, the growing demolitions in the West bank rendering many homeless, all the while questioning the right to a safe home.

Repatriation is a short documentary that will follow two key narrative threads: firstly, Erjok’s desire and journey for integration. 

Transporting the viewer from Nairobi to Kakuma, the second thread comes as a mix of beautiful stories from the host community, civil workers, expatriates and more whose lives will be affected by the closure of the camps. Through a number of micro-narratives, we will hear their idea of home and why integration is difficult.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:638:"David Erjok is a poet, rapper and refugee activist. 

Through joint efforts with local NGOs, Erjok uses his words to cause an impact on the way refugees are seen and treated.

Academically gifted, witty and enterprising Erjok has been his family’s main bread-winner till he received a scholarship in 2019 to pursue a major in Communications at the Pan Africa Christian University in Nairobi. 

Born third in a family of four, Erjok will act as a guide as he takes the audience from Nairobi to Kakuma where he joins his mother and siblings to discuss the roadmap to South Sudan. A possible deterrent to him finishing his studies.

My given character is a bomb, goodness how can one girl be everything in one, amazing script.

I know this movie must be a hit considering how well Director Chuks handles his project. Glad to be part. 

Wasn’t sure of where the story was headed at first but the endpoint is wow. In love with my character (kayode).

I know how detailed Mercy (producer) can be when picking a script so I never expected anything less.

Good story but I might have preferred the character lami to have been a boy.

We can’t wait for this project, love the plotting.

Excellent use of English language and of course the promotion of the northern dialect is fantastic and I love the degree of suspense.

The ward, which used to be a depot for slaves for the colonial period, is where Mzee encountered his first music lessons and still lives up to date.

Alongside his friends he composed a song “Naitaka Bango” which gave the music genre its name.

He was faced with a series of band hopping and breaking during a time when reggae music was making its way into Africa. Like any other musician he was often engaged in band wrangles. However, he believed in the developing a new music genre for his people and decided to start a fresh band with his own children whom he had taught how to play different kinds of instruments over a period of time. His son, Jimmy Ngala, carries on his father’s legacy with a modernized style using his Tamaduni band.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:2017:"More than nine years after the protests began, Syria has known one of the largest exodus of its modern history, especially towards Lebanon, a country itself under high tension and sharing a particular history with neighboring Syria. 

Now, Syrians constitute one of the largest displaced populations in modern history (8 millions people inside the country and 5 millions outside). Despite having opened its borders Lebanon’s policy towards them has hardened since 2015, making renewals for temporary residence permits almost impossible. 

For instance, Lebanon does not recognize the “right of the soil”. Syrians living in Lebanon, in most cases for long years, are in a difficult situation: most of them are illegal residents, dozens of thousands of new- born children on Lebanese soil are stateless and if a Syrian dies in Lebanon, his/her body is often not accepted in cemeteries. What I essentially want is to capture the desires, goals, and dreams, the relentless humanity of those people enduring an inhumane situation, unwanted wherever they go.

For about a year and a half, I started conducting remote research from by home country of Tunisia, to draw out the first basis of the project. The film received development support from the IDFA Bertha Fund, the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture and the Beirut Film Station (Goethe Institute Lebanon), which allowed me to make several trips to Lebanon and feed my research. 

That’s how I met Fadia, Leena, and Abou Ala who started telling me about their lives. Thanks to these encounters, I was able to conceive a first narrative framework for my project and a provisional structure.

The film will be composed of these portraits at different moments of life, and put together, they will create a storyline which will go from pregnancy to exile and emancipation. These characters make up the pieces of a much more complex puzzle. They represent the multiplicity of humanity, at a time when displaced populations are often considered as statistics.";s:22:"characters_description";s:630:"Leena is 6 months pregnant and lives in a tower in the north of Tripoli, Lebanon, along with a dozen other Syrian families ; Abou Ala lives in an informal settlements in the Bekaa Valley region, he is obsessed with the fact to bury his elderly father with dignity ; Fadia dreams of immigrating to Canada where she will be able to start hormonal treatment to become a woman.

The three of them have fled war-torn Syria and found refuge in Lebanon. Through their portraits emerge the fractures and paradoxes of a region under high tension as each one of them is struggling to achieve a goal and realize a dream in a hostile exile.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1640:"The film is to be shot mostly in Beirut, but also in the coastal cities of Tyr (south of the country) and Tripoli (in the north) in order to properly cover the nationwide humanitarian tragedy that is happening there. Lebanon has become the equivalent of an open-air camp now that the number of Syrians refugees on its soil is almost reaching 1.5 million people. Scattered across the country these men an women live in “informal settlements” and “collective shelters” but also in disused and abandoned buildings, in huts in the middle of fields or in garages and deposits.

Regarding my filmmaking approach, I intend to do most of the shots with handheld camera. The different portraits will also be part of a larger mosaic of people and families living in different situations and different locations in Lebanon. During editing, long shots will punctuate the film, as a way of reporting on their marginal status. Shots that will cross the line of conventional editing, as if to retain as many gestures, sensations and emotions as possible.

How can one be filming when he/she is at the heart of one of the most important events in terms of international issues?
This represents to me a visceral question, since my body is being involved in the process as a filming and testifying tool. This singular situation calls for a cinematographic reflection and invention. My documentary will not be informative nor didactic, but rather intimate, close to the people I will film. It will pay attention to what surrounds them - Lebanon as a territory and as a society. It focuses on deconstructing rather than constructing a discourse.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:2016:"Umra Omar was raised in Lamu by her grandmother before studying and working in the US as a psychologist. She returned home in 2014 just as Lamu was attacked by Al Shabab fighters, leaving dispensaries & schools in the area deserted. That’s when Umra founded Safari Doctors to provide medical services to the communities cut-off by the conflict. 

After 6 years growing the organization beyond expectations, the Lamu streets are overflowing with trash while the state-run medical facilities have deteriorated further, often empty of personnel, medical supplies & even running water. Umra’s frustration with a corrupt local government has finally reached breaking point, and her decision to run for Governor (the highest seat of power) in the upcoming elections is already disrupting the male-dominated political order, who’ve never had to contend with a female candidate so vocal about their failing leadership.  

Situated on Kenya’s northern coastal border, Lamu is famous for its exquisite Swahili architecture, 14th Century old town & untouched tropical islands. Isolated & neglected since independence, Lamu is the third poorest county in Kenya. But change is imminent with a $25B infrastructure project featuring a China-funded mega-port, industrial city, coal power plant and oil pipeline. This has triggered a scramble for land by outside businessmen, as tensions rise with the locals whose fisheries and mangrove forests are being destroyed, along with a growing Kenyan and US military presence trying to gain control over lawless southern Somalia.

It is amongst this geo-political quagmire that 37-year-old Umra is transitioning from humanitarian hero to a bare-knuckled political organizer. With no political experience or corporate backing, amidst a growing onslaught of misogynistic vitriol, this film is a close-and-intimate chronicle of Umra’s decision to dance with the devil, revealing the huge personal costs to her and her family as she enters the scrappy arena of Kenyan politics.";s:22:"characters_description";s:2022:"Umra Omar, the eldest of 3 sisters, grew up barefoot in the remote Pate Island village of Tchundwa, raised by her grandmother, a matriarch who had 8 husbands and 18 children.  Reunited with her parents in Nairobi after they finished their studies, Umra was awarded a high-school scholarship at Atlantic College in Wales before studying neuroscience & psychology at Oberlin College in USA. After her first placements in Washington DC and New York City, she returned to Kenya in 2014 for a job with Open Society Foundation, before the Al Shabaab attacks in Lamu compelled her to start Safari Doctors.

Umra’s father, Omar Bwana is an anomaly amongst Swahili men for educating his three daughters at an ivy-league level. As a young man, his work in preserving Swahili culture impressed the paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey, and together they founded Lamu Museum, excavating the many ancient Swahili ruins dotted around the archipelago. Omar was a prolific political organiser in the 1950’s, forming the Shungwaya Party to begin agitating for Kenya’s independence. In 1972 he was selected by President Moi as a nominated Member of Parliament before becoming chairman of National Museums of Kenya. Umra’s biggest cheerleader, he has been quietly pulling strings behind the scenes & calling upon his political contacts to open their doors to his daughter.

Other characters in the film include Umra’s 2 children Azza & Bwana. Umra’s chief-of-staff Ismael Bwana & her campaign manager Sande Oyolo, who is closely aligned with William Ruto, the current Vice-President of Kenya, and favourite to win the presidency in 2022.

Umra’s mother and two sisters are also of interest. Since Umra’s announcement to run, they are asked for money everywhere they go, and the prices for a boat-taxi, motorbike or even a meal at a restaurant have now doubled. Already uncomfortable with this disruption to their lives, they are not yet agreeable to be in the film, but we hope this will change as the campaign progresses";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2019:"UMRA is an intimate and personal feature-length documentary following the life of a political candidate over 18 months leading to election day.  We will mix verite scenes & informal interviews filmed with deeply saturated colours and a sharp, cinematic visual approach in the style of an international noir spy-thriller, set amongst the enchanting fishing-village of Lamu.

Iconic for it’s fusion of cultures over thousands of years of Indian Ocean trade between Africa, Arabia, Europe, India and China, Lamu’s coral fortresses hold ancient secrets that pass with the wispy perfume of fully-veiled women in black buibuis. Donkeys bray throughout the day as traders dust away sand from their stalls of tropical fruit & spices. The Imam’s 5 daily calls to prayer resonate through the narrow cobbled streets & an influx of men in white kanzus enter and exit the many mosques for their time with Allah, a refreshing purity amongst the otherwise stifling heat.

The relaxed observational scenes of Umra and her family at home will contrast the intense pressure and chaos of the political campaign & rallies. We will play visually with a dual consciousness which Umra describes as a mental separation of her real life self (known only to her friends and family) from her public ‘poster’ persona (alone and isolated, where people demand everything from her like a walking ATM).  We also want to visually explore Umra’s background in neuro-science, psychology and public-health, and her love of chess, to articulate a deeply cerebral awareness of human nature, and how that translates into her political strategy.

Musically the film will feature an original score co-composed by director Maia (a prolific Kenyan musician) together with local swahili musicians who carry the richness of Taarab music, fusing middle-eastern scales with stringed orchestras and deep african drum syncopation.  The score will also be electronic, gritty and industrial at times, to build and release the story’s tension & drama.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:132:"Filming has continued in May and June, several more foundational scenes have been captured.  Currently concentrating of fundraising.";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:2008:"UMRA is a story that needs to be told now, and needs to be told well - with a passion and tenacity that mirrors the protagonist. Our first 2 features (The Letter, 2019 and How to Build a Library, in production) also feature unbelievably strong women who spoke to us so deeply that we kept at it for years because these are the stories the world needs to see.

Our third feature, UMRA is our most ambitious and risky project yet: with a short time-frame, in a location where logistics are expensive, security is volatile, and a protagonist who is ruffling some very powerful feathers. Since November 2020, we’ve travelled to Lamu 3 times and managed to film and cut a fundraising trailer without any financial support, while simultaneously releasing and producing our first 2 films.

Having captured several key scenes of the foundational stages of the campaign, our primary goal has been to form a deep relationship with Umra built on trust, honesty and mutual respect.  Having known Umra and her sisters since 2015, we were able to jump straight into filming with her and her kids, staying at her place to immerse ourselves into her life and enjoy many long conversations into the night to understand each other better and discuss the overwhelming need for a political revolution in Kenya. This is the foundation on which the next 18 months of filming rests, together with our cultural awareness, speaking the language and our own Swahili-roots (Maia’s father’s family lineage connects back to Lamu sultan in the 1800’s, Umra’s father even has a book about the life of Maia’s Great-Grandfather).

Lamu is a heavily walled city, insular and encrypted to most outsiders.  Umra and her family are unique in their openness to a film crew, and between the strength of our relationship, her love of the camera and a strong pride to showcase her culture and homeland, this film will provide an insight into swahili culture, family-life and local Kenyan politics that few films have ever achieved.";s:14:"representation";s:1943:"As we see time & again, Kenyan superheroes like Umra are ultimately powerless in a broken system, and the film will highlight the immense price paid by those who try to change it. A strong dramatic engine is inherent in Umra’s mission, along with a clear ending. The 2 main narrative challenges we anticipate are (1) accessing her political opponents, and (2) capturing the protagonist’s more ruthless side which may contradict her clean public image. By employing a good local fixer we can overcome the 1st & the 2nd will be solved by remaining independent, which Umra understands is a vital ingredient to making the story realistic & compelling. Umra cannot survive the journey unscathed, and she is open & honest about us filming the risks & moral compromises she must make to win.

So far we’ve shot everything ourselves (Maia: sound / Chris: camera). On our 3rd, current trip in Lamu we’ve brought a DoP from Nairobi to build familiarity with the subjects, as we prepare to give birth to our first child in August 2021. A grant from DOCA would allow us to ensure the DoP & fixer can continue capturing the unfolding events from July to October. We then intend to rent a house in Lamu long-term & make a second base to continue filming the campaign through to August 2022. 

The film will be shot in 4K with cine prime lenses to achieve a cinematic vitality.  We’ve been inspired by films like “Knock Down The House”, “War Room” as well as Samaher Alqadi’s feminist inditement of the arab spring “As I Want”, and Sam Soko’s “Softie” which lay bare the flawed Kenyan political process.  We want to push the documentary genre by emulating the framing, suspenseful editing, music and aerial cinematography from film-noirs like “Chinatown” and spy-thrillers such as “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” & “Bourne Identity'' which we feel can help elevate the film’s aesthetic and commercial appeal.

Our story will focus on Shiku a mother who does everything to keep her child off the streets and Donga, a child who was kicked out by the mother to be raised by the streets.

Our first character is Nairobi. She symbolizes a place with the highest form of financial redemption but when you scratch deeper, the risks attached to succeeding in the city become clear. She nurtures, shelters and feeds millions daily, the difference is how she interacts with her children.

Shiku is a mother of two and a low end sex worker who lost one of her sons through extrajudicial execution and who currently tries to transition to becoming an upstanding member of society.

Donga, once a violent criminal on the police’s most wanted list, now wears many hats; tour guide, taxi driver. He is actively pursuing music and seeks to offer a better foundation to his son by being a positive male role model.

Donga and Shiku have known nothing but bare minimums. To the backdrop of excess, they have received nominal guidance, childhood, education, love, shelter, you name it. Circumstances that have informed their past and present pursuits. Having lost a great deal along the way, the hunger to move from reduced qualities of life keeps them searching for better times.

Our characters are making changes to their lives from their regrettable pasts to hopeful futures, with their children as catalysts.

We follow them as they modify their lifestyles to assimilate to their quests for legitimacy. Previewing what it takes to be reinstituted into the same society that had denied them access to resources and skills from the very beginning, as well as showing their efforts to provide what they lacked to their offspring.
";s:22:"characters_description";s:1256:"Shiku - 
One of many sex workers who patrol the dimly lit Nairobi night streets. Midway through her pursuit, she received damning news about her eldest son; a 19-year-old boy who was shot twelve times by a notorious killer cop in Eastleigh, Nairobi. Now left in limbo, and with the advent of Coronavirus restrictions, she does ‘regular’ jobs while searching for closure from her loss to keep her second born son, Imran, off the streets and avoid him suffering the same fate.

Donga
Boisterous and driven, a proud father, budding and talented musician. Donga’s life has been shaped by bullets and blood. From the age of 8, Donga was raised by the streets that left him with no option but to beg, steal and eventually become one of Nairobi's wanted criminals.
 
To earn a living in hopes of funding his musical pursuits, he guides paying tourists through the city he previously tormented as a gang member; showing them a haunting previous life he is trying to separate himself from. Between surviving in a cut-throat town by yearning to opt out of the street life and the frustrations of booking studio space with nothing more than the promises of passion, what remains essential to him is the need to present a better father figure to his son.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1567:"We want to portray our city and its inhabitants oscillating between beauty and realism, capturing the beauty of situations and the fragility of the people.

Whenever our protagonists interact with their children, they reveal a calmness. The camera reflects this in still imagery of planned compositions. The anxieties and movements are of human causes and experiences, something we show through a handheld camera when we are on the streets. This accentuates the grit and realism of Nairobi's fast pace. The lens will expose the raw developments of the characters as they unfold from the comforts of their personal spaces to the rat race society with minimal staging.

The film will use a mix of cinema verite, direct cinema and interviews to paint pictures of Shiku and Donga’s experiences of living and parenting in Nairobi. Every scene and image presented will be handled delicately and with a lot of dignity. The motion picture will oscillate between the past using symbolic poetry showcasing the lives of Donga and Shiku’s first born son, and the present, depicted by beautiful imagery of their current state. 

The audio will consist of ambient recordings of the environments, city and surroundings from footage captured and from the narratives of interviews conducted from the subjects.
The main voices and focus of the picture will be Shiku and Donga who will weave us in and out of their daily life proceedings, introducing us to characters who advance subplots relating to or complementing their journey to breaking free from the loop of hardship.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:156:"We recently completed the Follow The Nile development & mentorship program 2020/2021 which was followed by a successful pitch at DokFest Munich in May 2021.";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:577:"My society has an INCLINATION to sensationalize people living odd lives and odd jobs based on person perception. This film invites its viewers into the lives of Shiko and Donga with a frangible perception. It hopes to reverse the desensitizing narratives derived from fear, disgust and negative moral judgments like the ones I harboured before the journey to making this film.
The protagonists unapologetically characterize a rare mental fortitude to be who they are. Their lives invoke subliminal conversations like childcare, morality, mortality and love in today's society.";s:14:"representation";s:1687:"I feel that as human beings we all have a cycle that we are caught up in and want to break at one point in our lives. This is all in hopes of entering an easier loop that promises a better life than the one we are currently in. 

When I first heard Donga's story, I took a moment to reflect on my reaction when a street kid comes to my car window to beg when the traffic lights turn red. I mostly didn't even look to the side with the fear that I'd make eye contact which would intensify the begging. I never had a moment where I stopped to ask what their story was or to even accord them the respect of responding to their knock on my window. And this is all from the social stigma I've unconsciously carried towards street kid. 

Then, I met Shiku. The first footage I watched of her reached out to me because she spoke with honesty and vulnerability I would not have expected out of a sex worker. Again, because of the social stigma and negative narratives I've carried around prostitution, which never allowed me to view the humans behind these branding. Shiku was morning the death of her son and I could hear the undertones of self blame and doubt as she reflected on how she raised her son.

This film embraces some very bold themes and bears a universal outlook as it invokes universal conversations around parenting, love and mortality in today's society. 

Donga and Shiku's pursuits for a better life expose a larger societal issue of its over-dependence on broken systems that promise people redemption while consistently devaluing human lives.

Il se retrouve dans la rue, avec ses camarades du mouvement FRAPP pour lutter contre les inégalités et l’injustice. ";s:15:"story_structure";s:2065:"Le 2 juin 2019, la chaine britannique BBC diffuse une enquête de Mayeni Jones, intitulée : « Sénégal : Scandale à 10 milliards de dollars ». Dans ce reportage, la BBC affirme détenir les preuves qu’Aliou Sall, frère cadet du président de la République Macky Sall, a touché des pots-de-vin en 2012 pour l’attribution de deux concessions pétrolières à l’homme d’affaires Frank Timis. 
Ce reportage de la BBC déclenche un soulèvement populaire au Sénégal. Les jeunes sortent dans la rue et se mobilisent pour protester contre le gouvernement de Macky Sall car ils estiment intolérable que les dirigeants sénégalais et les multinationales s’enrichissent au détriment de la population. Parmi ces manifestants, il y a Abdoulaye Seck, 21 ans, étudiant en troisième année de Licence d’analyse et politiques économiques à l’Université Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD) de Dakar. 
Abdoulaye Seck est très engagé politiquement. Il est le président des étudiants du mouvement FRAPP, Front révolutionnaire anti-impérialiste populaire et panafricaine. Depuis les années 2000, les conditions de vie à l’université sont devenues de plus en plus précaires à cause de la mauvaise gestion étatique. Les étudiants dorment dans les couloirs sur des matelas. Il faut se réveiller à 5 heures du matin pour pouvoir se doucher à temps. Pour lutter contre cette vie dure à l’université, les étudiants se sont mobilisés pour mettre en place un mouvement citoyen, le FRAPP. Ce mouvement veut réveiller les consciences des populations et mobiliser autour de la lutte pour une justice sociale.  
C’est dans ce contexte que le pays bascule dans la révolte en mars 2021.Le sentiment d’injustice et les frustrations provoquées par la crise de la pandémie dégénèrent en violentes manifestations : il y a 10 morts et près de 600 blessés. L’enjeu du film repose sur la trajectoire d’Abdoulaye et son impact dans la réalité : Abdoulaye peut-il aller au bout de cette lutte ? Cette lutte peut-elle mener à une révolution ?";s:22:"characters_description";s:1295:"Abdoulaye Seck a 21 ans. Il est le fils d’un cheminot, syndicaliste et militant de gauche. Il a grandi dans une famille où la conscience anticoloniale est très forte. Il habite à Keur Massar, un quartier populaire de la banlieue dakaroise, où les conditions de vie sont catastrophiques. 
Il est en troisième année de Licence d’analyse et politiques économiques à l’université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar. Il est très engagé politiquement. Abdoulaye est au cœur de mon film. 
Si j’ai choisi Abdoulaye parmi tous ces jeunes, c’est sans doute en raison de son charisme et de sa sensibilité. A mes yeux, il incarne la jeunesse. Il se sent très concerné par l’avenir du Sénégal. A sa manière, il se bat pour son pays tous les jours. Malgré son jeune âge, il est déjà considéré comme un leader. 
Le fait de partager le point de vue d’Abdoulaye nous amène à réfléchir sur la situation du pays, la vie quotidienne de cette jeunesse : les difficultés, les rêves, les aspirations. En filmant Abdoulaye, je montre symboliquement le vécu quotidien de cette jeunesse.
Abdoulaye est le personnage auquel le spectateur s’identifie. Son engagement et sa détermination donnent au spectateur les éléments de sa propre réflexion sur la lutte de cette jeunesse. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2026:"En tant que cinéma du réel, République, Pétrole, Révolution puise ses fondements dans l’histoire du temps présent. C’est un film qui se construit sur la base d’un mouvement de contestation sociale d’ampleur inconnue depuis le mouvement « Y’en a marre » de 2012. Il s’agit donc pour moi de suivre le fil de l’histoire et de filmer l’évolution d’Abdoulaye et du mouvement dans une perspective qui se veut sensible. Je suis les évènements avec simplicité en accompagnant mes personnages et je les filme dans cette réalité qu’ils cherchent à faire évoluer. Cette logique me permet d’être authentique, d’être au plus proche des personnes et d’inscrire le projet dans l’actualité sur un temps long. Filmer Abdoulaye en mouvement, c’est filmer un possible avenir en construction.
L’espace du film est son territoire, ou ses territoires : la ville de Dakar, sa banlieue, parfois les régions. Si le récit est clairement ancré à Dakar grâce à Abdoulaye et au FRAPP, le film montre aussi à quel point le mouvement est implanté en banlieue et comment les principes du mouvement essaiment dans tout le pays à la faveur des luttes initiées aux côtés des communautés locales. Mais Dakar et sa banlieue restent au cœur du film, plus qu’un décor, presque un troisième personnage qui serait nécessaire à la concrétisation des rêves d’Abdoulaye et de ses camarades. 
Le processus de filmage va s’étaler sur un temps long de plusieurs mois. J’ai commencé à effectuer des repérages aux débuts du mouvement. Ce sont des images prises sur le vif, des points de vue subjectifs et la compilation d’une documentation permettant de comprendre la situation du pays (archives, contenus internet, presse écrite…).

I am the camera. The one that evolves in my life and also a witness to events and manifestations taking place in and around me. I let the traditional objects speak as they take my place and talk about tradition. I am a camera trying to film what is hardly visible in an abstract poetic approach of imagery.
I have made a choice to stay in the dynamics of a unique focus, using a focale length of 24MM. My photographic intention is to conserve the same focal view through-out the film. I am followed by another camera that observes and questions these spirits in surroundings of the village. This last camera  serves as a means to prime myself in it’s frame and also a means to relieve myself from the autobiographic character of the piece. I’m proposing a sort of contemporary creative medium that blends with the spirits of the legends and tales of Africa .

";s:15:"story_structure";s:1909:"Three Rivers, Birim, Ayensu and Densu have their sources from the Atewa Forest, a giant water tower in Ghana. These rivers provide drinking water for over 5 million Ghanaians. The Birim joins the Pra River which enters the sea at Shama in the West. Densu joins the sea in the Greater Accra flowing some 240 kilometers from its source. Ayensu joins the sea at Winneba Wetlands area flowing some 116 kilometers. This water tower is under siege as the government is bent on mining bauxite in the forest. 

Ghana has a huge deposit of bauxite discovered in three locations namely, Awaso – which has been under severe mining in the past 76 years, Nyanahin – which has been given out last year to be mined and the popular Atewa Forest – which has been used as an exchange for 2 billion dollars from the Chinese Synohydro Company. The Atewa Forest has been earmarked for a National Park where experts say its ecological benefits over a longer period far outweighs the benefits of mining bauxite in the forest. The forest is Ghana’s remaining closed forest covering a total of 263 square kilometers.
 
In 2017 the Government of Ghana exchanged the forest for a 2 billion Chinese facility which has seen fierce resistance from NGOs, Community folks and CSOs. In 2019 the Chinese miners have created access routes in the Atewa forest. 

This story investigates how bauxite mining will destroy the fine ecosystem and contaminate the source of drinking water for over 6 million Ghanaians. It will also investigate as a prelude to the main documentary the projects that are supposed to be done under the arrangement and how far they have come up. It will require travelling to all the project sites and seeing at first-hand what they look like. The investigations will also extend to how community folks in Awaso bauxite mining community live in poverty and have seen no development for the past 77 years.

A character who has been applying to work at the Awaso Bauxite Mine without success will be filmed – he will show us how his community has survived for the past 77 years of bauxite mining.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:1999:"Today the African woman is facing a decision that ultimately decides her fate as a girl-child, woman, mother, and wife. Her relevance today and in the future depends on understanding who she was, who she is now, and how she creates a lasting legacy for the next generation. 

For centuries, the African woman's history is not accessible as that of the western woman. Even in documentaries, the history of the African woman barely gets a mention. We call to mind the groundbreaking documentary, The Ascent of Women by Amanda Foreman. Yes, many African women were not very pleased that Africa women got minimal coverage. That is an indication that the African woman's story is for Africans to tell. 

This film decolonizes history and situates it in a social-cultural context. It studies how ancient African women withstood and fought against slavery and European influence for decades. How did they survive? How did they run a viable economic society while raising a family? It brings to the fore what the contemporary African woman needs to know about her heritage, culture, and tradition. It interrogates why the Africa woman seems to be out of touch with who she is. It also examines how religion and colonialism introduced patriarchy to Africans and at what point gender oppression festered across the continent.

Structurally, the film weaves an in-depth look into the lives of these matriarchs and their present contemporaries across Africa. They come together to share their stories revealing unknown information as never seen before. Shooting in a cinema verite style, we provide a fascinating window into the characters' lives, capturing and documenting their experiences and knowledge. It looks at the different regions to understand the cultural similarities and differences, the advent of gender oppression, and how to defy societal limitations. The film covers the pre-colonial African woman, the divinity of the African woman, the culture of shame, and the feminist movement. 

";s:22:"characters_description";s:2006:"Four women gather by the fire pit to share powerful stories of some of the pre-colonial African women behind the most powerful empires like the Makeda of Ethiopia, Nefertiti of Egypt, Queen Anna Nziga of Angola. And that of the women who championed some powerful movements in Africa like Yaa Asantewa of Ghana, Nandi of South Africa, Moremi/Amina of Nigeria, and others of not so royal background. The documentary unravels how these women existed, looking at their different life stages (birth, initiation, rites of passage, religion, education). It uncovers how these matriarchs resisted the colonial masters, and defied societal limitations in a male-dominated world to thrive, carving their paths to success. The stories probes if colonialism and the introduction of western religion birthed gender inequality.

The women take us on a journey into the Africa woman's spirituality and the rejection of western ideals of divinity. It tells the story from the African cosmology perspective located within specific cultures on the divine woman. They unravel how the African woman communed with God before western religion, touching on specific areas such as (the body, the mind, meditation, prayer, and self-awareness). Their stories shed light on the feminine deities that exist in Africa.
These women take us on a pleasurable journey about the African woman's sexuality and how it evolved with time. It traces the origin of female circumcision and its effect, in addition to the myth about menstruation and orgasm. It delves into controversial areas such as female husbands (women marrying women for their husbands/partners) and the LGBT society (women who love other women). Examining these issues pushes boundaries and makes the conversation inclusive.
It examines the argument among academics that feminism is too radical to be African and does not capture the African woman’s realities. They tell the stories of extraordinary women who are creating their paths and shattering the glass ceilings.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1451:"Daughters of Africa is a feature-length documentary, which uses the narrative of Five women’s journey, stories, and history to engage viewers, inform, entertain, educate, empower, and drive the story forward. Their powerful dynamic story takes place over several decades and across some African continents. Professional narration is used between acts and to set the stage for the ongoing discussion. Key narrative scenes take place in practical locations, some by the fire pit and under the moonlight depicting the beautiful African scenery. As some of the women share their stories,  we hear the trusted voices of historians and experts as they affirm convictions or disagreements and offer different perspectives that engage the audience throughout the film, it shows scenic, historic locations, archival footages, and reenactments. The film is augmented by voice-over, family photos, and videos, etc. 
The colour palette shifts from the contrast of earthy brown, orange, black to green and warm yellow. To achieve the best cinematographic picture qualities, two full-frame cameras will be used with accompanying lighting facilities. The sound will be recorded externally, using the boom, multi-channel field recorder, and lapel microphones regulated with appropriate sound equipment for ultimate audio output. Tracks, sliders, drones, DJI Ronin, jibs, and other motion picture gadgets will be used in achieving an enduring moving picture film.

The contrast I witnessed was stark. The way the people in the city carried on about their days, totally unaware of the natural beauty of the night sky that exists just above their heads - but that they are unable to see for themselves - was a harsh reminder that humans have become extremely disconnected from the natural world, and need to find ways to reconnect.

After doing extensive research, I got in touch with Professor Thebe Medupe who was very keen to get involved in any way possible. He is passionate about raising a generation of “scientifically literate” young South Africans, in order to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to make sustainable, and ecologically responsible choices into the future.

The story structure will mimic the fluid way in which San people tell stories. However, certain archetypes will be present in the film. The first part of the film will focus on inspiring. We will then delve into the problems at hand - both environmental, socio-economic and political. We will explore how political forces fractured the San communities and seriously hindered them. Similarly, we will explore how Apartheid in South Africa fostered the idea that “black children don’t belong in science”. Facing the challenges that our characters have faced, we will begin to unpack how these can be remedied and we can begin to trace a new path forward.

The film will also include both Medupe and our San characters’ observations of how society is run today, and how modern day people (particularly those in first world countries) have come to be completely disconnected from the natural world. We will get our characters views on how this can change, and why it’s so critical and urgent to implement these changes.

A new way forward will be presented - one which urges people to reconnect with their roots. ";s:22:"characters_description";s:541:"Professor Thebe Medupe is an astrophysicist living and working in Johannesburg, South Africa. Growing up in a rural village in South Africa, he would look up at the night sky as a child and become inspired to study the stars. Growing up, he built his own telescope, and later went on to study at the University of Cape Town. Thebe is now a professor and working as the deputy dean of his faculty. He has built his own space observatory in Mahikeng, Gauteng and works with South African children to inspire them to become involved in science.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1941:"This is a story about the human relationship with the cosmos, from a uniquely African perspective. The film will open with a beautiful timelapse of the night sky, with Prof Thebe Medupe’s voiceover explaining how life on earth comes from stars.

The following scene will take us into the Kalahari desert. We will hear traditional San music along with closeups of the San dance ritual - feet on the ground, hands playing instruments, eyes looking up into the sky, and fire flickering against a dark background. Our San character will explain the significance of the stars in the San culture. He will talk about how for their community, living in perfect harmony with the land has been their way of life for hundreds of thousands of years. We will include shots of the San men tracking an animal, or the way they read the signs of the environment such as looking at the movement of sand and plants. Drone shots will establish the setting of the desert. We will then move into the challenges that the San face, using creatively styled cutaways as a metaphor.

The film will allow our San characters to shape the narrative with an African voice. It will be more fluid than the typical Three Act Structure.

We will then return to Thebe Medupe as he talks about his upbringing and his journey towards becoming a professor of astrophysics. We will have shots of him in his home in Johannesburg, as well as shots of him showing us around his space observatory that he built in Mahikeng, Gauteng. We will also film Thebe in his classroom, working with children as he teaches them astronomy.

The film will comprise of sweeping drone shots, landscape and star timelapses, slow motion shots, professionally lit interview setups, emotive and astral sound design with indigenous notes influenced by Hans Zimmer’s Interstellar composition, and characters who inspire a deep fascination and wonder for our planet and its place in the universe.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:138:"Our application for a filming permit in Botswana has been submitted successfully and we expect to get the go-ahead to film in August 2021.";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:1865:"There has never been a more critical time in history for humans to reconnect to the environment. If we are to survive as a species, we need to stop seeing ourselves as separate from nature. Right now, it is more critical than ever to drive home the message that human beings depend on healthy, in-tact ecosystems for our survival. We are part of nature.

The San people of the Kalahari serve as a perfect example of how humans have been living in tune with the landscape for millennia. The fascinating, awe-inspiring night sky serves as a link between all humans that have ever lived. From both a scientific and a traditional perspective, life on earth comes from stars, including us.

Lying on the ground in Sutherland, South Africa, looking up at the night sky, this simple yet highly complex idea hit home for me. It was at that moment I decided this film needed to be made. I realised that if more people had the opportunity to experience the splendour of the night sky, perhaps that would inspire them to feel connected to nature, and to want to protect it.

Receiving a grant from National Geographic Society for this project was a massive honour, and helped me truly believe in the weight of my idea. With National Geographic backing me, I am more determined than ever to bring this film to life. With some extra production funding, I am confident that we can tell this important story at the high standard at which it deserves to be told. 

I tell stories that convey undertones of empathy, gentleness, subtly and unique leadership. I am interested in reaching audiences on an emotional level, while bringing them closer to science in an engaging and deeply awe-inspiring way. A unique balance between education and entertainment, I believe, is the key to inspiring an audience to engage with the content long after the credits have started rolling.";s:14:"representation";s:1196:"Pre-production is well under way for this project. We have secured some funding from National Geographic Society, and with some extra funding, we will be able to produce this film at the highest possible standard.

Our filming will take place in three locations: Mafikeng (South Africa), the Central Kalahari (Botswana), and Sutherland (South Africa). We have a local fixing company, Okavango Filming, on board for our Botswana leg of the production. They have a long-standing relationship with the San community of the Kalahari and understand the dynamics of the community deeply. They are helping us with obtaining film permits, and will be there to mediate between the film crew and the San people.

We aim to film Prof Thebe Medupe in August 2021 in his hometown where he built his own observatory in Mahikeng, Gauteng. From there we will move on to Grasslands, Botswana, to film the San people and their stories. In September, we will take a trip to Sutherland and film Prof Medupe there, where we will look at the science that is taking place at the SALT Observatory, and how the Prof is involved in this work.

But almost everyone I knew, from family members to close friends to strangers, had delivered via C-Section. This got me wondering how it became that giving birth, something  that our bodies are designed to do naturally, is considered no longer possible without medical intervention for such a majority. Why Science is invariably the solution to getting babies out and how highly invasive procedures have become the norm. I didn’t understand that.

My quest to getting the information that would help influence my choice was not only eye opening but also stirred the desire to empower other women as much as possible. Something that is largely lacking since most people trust medicine and medical practitioners so much more than they trust their own bodies, their own rights or their own free will. And, are heavily paying the price both financially and physically. I sincerely hope this film helps to change all that.

1. Aggie, the filmmaker who's own birthing journey inspired this film. She's strong-willed, daring and brave.
2. Lucy, the midwife that helped deliver Aggie's baby at her home residence in Nairobi. She's warm, kind, gentle and wise.
3. Dr. Charles Muteshi, the OB/GYN who they interviewed to get his views on the birthing options in Kenya. He's open, clear and honest, but also clever and diplomatic.
4. Maggie, a woman who compares her varying birthing experiences and draws conclusions on the medical practices when it comes to pregnant women. She has some regrets and advise to share with other mothers.
5. Sonnie, who shares a horrific experience with her first child under the care of a medical institution that was run like a business. The lessons learnt, the price paid, the outcomes of the experience and what has been done since. Despite everything, she is a strong, positive and generous woman.

We also need to get more statistics to back up the information shared in this documentary, as well as other experts in the matter to shaer their data or give some anecdotes.

Ils ont besoin de la quinine, cette poudre blanche extrait de l’écorce de l’arbre quinquina, reconnue comme médicament curatif du paludisme. Des ingénieurs français engagent des recherches pour l’acclimatation de la plante de quinquina dans l’Ouest du Cameroun. Après 32ans de recherches, la plante s’acclimate avec succès.  Entre expropriation des terres et travaux forcés, la station quinquina compte environ 6 millions de pieds de quinquina avec une production d’écorces de quinquina qui s’élève à 260 tonnes pour une production de 20 tonnes de sulfate de quinine environ dans l’usine qui démarre en 1955. Cette usine ne fonctionnera que 4 ans et sera laissée à l’abandon.
 Face à cette friche, les questions qui viennent en général à l’esprit sont : Qu’est-ce qu’il y avait à cet endroit ? Et ensuite : Comment en est-on arrivé-là ?
Nous nous inspirerons du processus scientifique de reconstitution, qui consiste à partir d’un fossile ou d’une friche pour imaginer l’objet ou l’être vivant au moment de sa splendeur. Et ensuite il y a l’arrêt, une sorte de mort réelle et symbolique qui enclenche le processus de fossilisation, qui aboutit 60 ans plus tard à cette friche aujourd’hui.
La reconstitution et la fossilisation sont les 2 procédés que nous utiliserons pour raconter un aspect paradoxal de l’histoire coloniale et post coloniale du Cameroun à partir de ces décombres.  FRICHE !... Et les décombres se souviennent met en rapport les acteurs directs et indirects qui ont assisté à la mise en place de la culture du quinquina, à la construction et à la mise en service de l’usine, à sa fermeture et enfin à l’abandon de la culture du quinquina.

Non loin du centre urbain, gît dans la broussaille, ce qui reste de cette ancienne usine qui produisait des médicaments pour lutter contre le paludisme. Il y a 15 ans, on pouvait encore y voir d’énormes cuves et des tuyauteries allant dans tous les sens, vestige d’une activité industrielle florissante. 
Le sentiment de peur devant la taille de ces bâtiments a laissé la place à la curiosité de savoir quelle mystérieuse histoire se cachait derrière ces ruines. Ma surprise fut grande d’apprendre que c’est dans ce lieu que se fabriquait la quinine, un médicament avec lequel ont grandi plusieurs générations d’Africains. Bien avant le sida très médiatisé ces dernières années, le paludisme reste la plus grande cause de mortalité au Cameroun. Dans le contexte actuel dominé par la pandémie Corona virus dont, selon certains spécialistes, la chloroquine, médicament de synthèse de la quinine, serait la réponse efficace, on ne peut s’empêcher de se questionner sur la tragédie de cette usine.

« Quinine amère », a constitué une première approche factuelle, mais qui ne traitait pas des raisons profondes de l’abandon de l’usine. Dans le cadre de ses recherches, la réalisatrice est arrivée à une hypothèse selon laquelle, la question de la terre, liées aux expropriations pendant l’époque coloniale, ainsi que le désir des nouvelles élites camerounaises après les indépendances de s’approprier ce patrimoine foncier, au lieu de se soucier de l’intérêt général, seraient les raisons essentielles de l’abandon de l’usine. 
Cette quête se poursuivra aux archives nationales à Yaoundé, à Montpellier au CIRAD (né de l’Orstom et de la recherche en Outre-mer), pour comprendre comment la France a pu faire des investissements aussi importants pendant une vingtaine d’années et laisser à l’abandon une usine qui n’a fonctionné que cinq ans ? Une autre piste de réflexion est l’utilisation des médicaments de synthèse pour remplacer des médicaments à base de plantes au nom d’une modernité aux conséquences désastreuses pour la santé. Ce film sera une coproduction entre les sociétés Bandjoun Film Studio, Les Films du raphia et Merveilles Production.
Avec les Films du Raphia, une structure basée en France, nous entrerons en coproduction afin d’assurer les parties du tournage en France et aussi les finitions. Avec Merveilles Production, nous espérons faire le montage et une partie des finitions du projet à Cotonou. 
Le film sera diffusé dans le circuit CNA au Cameroun et dans les CNA des autres pays africains.
Le film sera disponible sur la chaine Vimeo on demand de la société ‘les films du Raphia’ et sur le site Patrimoines-Heritage.

Will they return home as free women?";s:15:"story_structure";s:1962:"The Republic Vrs documentary follows the story of two young women embroiled in separate murder cases and its unintended consequences on them and their families. Fati Issa; arrested and charged in 2014 with conspiracy to murder in the death of a banker was in prison remand for four years. Despite the physical and psychological toll of attending monthly court hearings, and the difficulty of raising her two-year-old child in a notorious slum, she remains hopeful. In 2018, Rita was remanded for stabbing her late boyfriend in a domestic abuse incident which resulted in his death. Their two-year old offspring, Wisdom is Rita’s strength as she goes through a lengthy court trial. 
As we follow Fati and Rita in and out of court, we get a glimpse of the boredom and routine of their lives, the danger of being in the grip of the law and the devastating effects of poverty and crime on women, children and the community. Will they return home as free women? If found guilty by the jury, they could face the death penalty. The film reminds us of Ghana’s laws; laws that grip the guilty and innocent; laws that require revision; laws that are enforced and those that are rarely mentioned. 
Through this documentary, we come very close to Rita and Fati’s ambitions and fears. We also see Accra’s buoyancy and its dormancy, the colour of its open markets and nearby sprawling neighbourhoods like Agbogbloshie where Fati lives. We see the frustration of passengers in traffic, worsened by noise pollution from old vehicles. The scene is a woven fabric of disconcerting cultural phenomenon. As for Fati and Rita, they constitute part of the low class urban poor who live on $2 daily. 

The Republic Vrs is an opportunity for everyone to reflect on life, freedom and privilege. To young people, it is a reminder of how prison can rob them of their productive years. To government and NGOs, it is an urgent call to reform policing and criminal investigation. ";s:22:"characters_description";s:1936:"FATI(30) FATI lives with her partner in one-bedroom crib in a crowded house at Agbogbloshie, a notorious slum in Accra. Fati is unemployed, but occasionally gets laundry work in her neighbourhood. In 2014, she was arrested for Conspiracy to murder along with four others. She spent 4 years in Nsawam Prison has been attending Court trial since 2017. She and her partner have a 2-year old son whom they take care of from taking cleaning and errand jobs. 
 
When fights and brawls breaks in the compound among the younger girls, Fati cautions them, occasionaly speaking Dagbani, a widely spoken language in the northern part of Ghana. Alone, she breaks down in tears while recollecting her time at Nsawam prison, how she went days without eating, how she grew lean, contemplating suicide many times. She regrets the situation but is also shocked about it. What will her family think when they see her in the newspapers with damning headline as a murderer or accomplice? 

RITA (27), victim of domestic violence, arrested in 2018 for murder, refused to abort baby, gave birth while in Prison. Has a 2-year old son. Attends monthly court sittings, awaiting trial. RITA lives with her parents, siblings and her two-year old son at Dome, a suburb of Accra. In the mornings, she assists her mother prepare Maize porridge for sale, after which she goes to hawk tupperware at Dome market. How does she tell her child when he’s grown that he was born in a prison? Before the incident that led to her arrest, she sold selling oranges. 

NANA ADWOA (32) UK-trained lawyer who works with Fair Justice Initiative, a human rights law firm based in Accra. Just returning from maternity leave, she combines full time work with full time babycare. The organization allows her to bring her baby along to work in Accra. Outside working hours, Nana Adwoa loves to spend quality time with her family, go to cinemas or just stream movies on weekends. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1006:"The Republic Vrs is cinema verite documentary, following the subjects directly. This gives the audience direct access to the story which creates empathy. Set in Ghana, the film is moving, solemn at times and boisterous at other times as we see contrasting landscapes and socio-economic divide. Shot over a period of five years, the audience witnesses the physical, psychological and emotional changes occurring in the lives of the subjects. ‘Sisters-in-law’, a documentary of how two women (prosecutor and judge) use the law to rescue women who are victims of domestic violence in anglophone Cameron, is a good reference for our film. 

Fati and Rita’s own narration leads viewers into the themes explored in the documentary. Key scenes occur in practical locations such as homes, churches, court, market, prisons, with an emphasis on movement. 

B-roll of menial workers in markets, families in amusement parks, schools will be used to give perspective and contrast to the subject’s situation.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:656:"We have filmed a fundraising teaser. We have started pre production to film principal photography. At the same time, we are doing more research as well as following up with our protagonists. This month, I received communication from the Ghana YMCA that there may be funding opportunities for my protagonist to support their skill acquisition under their projects. We intend following through with this and filming. 

The Republic Vrs has been selected among 25 projects under the Presidential Film Pitch Series organised by the National Film Authority of Ghana, a pipeline facilitation program to connect filmmakers with investors from around the world. ";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:2006:"My decision to produce a film on human rights spurred from a random discussion with Jonathan Osei Owusu, founder of Pos Foundation, an NGO that runs the ‘Justice for All Programme’ in Ghana, who told me how there are people who spend up to fifteen years in pre-trial detention in Ghana. This got me thinking for days.
Meanwhile, I had decided that my next project will be about human rights. Not sure which way to go, I began talking to lawyer friends, through which I eventually met Nana Adwoa, a human rights lawyer through whom I got to know my protagonists, Fati and Rita. 
I thought these young ladies have stories that many people can learn from, the danger of being in toxic relationships, and living in slums with high crime rates, the brutality of an unforgiving criminal and prison system, the psychological turmoil that going to prison causes, the stigma, the diminishing of human dignity and the will of survivors. 
Fati is determined to prove her innocence, and to use her story to educate other younger girls like her who migrate daily from the Northern part of Ghana to the south in search of work. Fati is currently unemployed, and dependent on her partner. Without formal education, she appears to be giving up on empowering herself economically. I am curious to document how she would evolve over the long period of filming, and to see what she does about her situation. 
I’m curious about the outcome of their trial and how it affects other facets of their lives. Rita and Fati believe their story will enlighten other young people about life and living it. 
I am ready to commit at least four years to making this documentary. Seeing how Nana Adwoa and her organization Fair Justice Initiative, is supporting less privileged young women inspire me. Going to court with Fati in mid-2020 was my first time in any court. When the court clerk called her case, the title of the documentary ‘The Republic Vrs’ struck me. By end of court, I was certain this is my next project. ";s:14:"representation";s:856:"9th May, 2021

Note of Intent
This is to acknowledge my commitment as a producer to work with Shakiru Akinyemi on the documentary project titled, “The Republic Vrs.”

Personally, I believe the urgency of this project in addressing lapses in Ghana’s criminal justice and investigations cannot be emphasized enough owing to similar prevalent cases that needs the attention of the right local and international authorities, hence my readiness to stretch my abilities on this.

Having successfully worked on other films that have won awards and reached millions across Africa and the world through online and offline mobile cinema tours, I am confident the mapped out distribution and marketing channels will push the project beyond the intended projects.
I am excited about this.

Your sincerely,

Elle est la chaire du dispositif narratif. Elle vient nourrir, contextualiser, étayer, documenter
les épisodes par la parole d’experts et d’intervenants reconnus. Ici, ce sont les enjeux historiques qui s’expriment. La grande Histoire. Celle enseignée, celle en recherche, celle parfois oubliée et que nous souhaitons mettre en lumière dans chacun des épisodes. Iconographies et archives. Pour accompagner la plongée des spectateurs dans une époque et des espaces géographiques qu’ils méconnaissent. Pour aider à donner la mesure de ces empires et ancrer le récit dans une réalité, la série s’appuie sur de l’iconographie, mais aussi des images d’archives souvent contemporaines qui permettront d’illustrer le propos : fouilles archéologiques, évènements, actualités, cérémonies du FESPACO, etc.
Une carte animée. Cette carte au graphisme travaillé est un élément essentiel dans la structuration du récit. D’un point de vue géographique, elle permet au spectateur de se situer à l’intérieur du continent africain. Elle sert également de clé pour voyager dans le temps et doit faciliter les passages d’une époque à une autre pour retracer l’épopée d’un empire depuis sa formation jusqu’à sa chute. Réalisée en animation, elle permet enfin de zoomer ou dézoomer à loisir et de mettre en scène les ellipses (construction de villes, grandes batailles, extensions d’empires...). La fiction incarnée. L’absence d’images, d’iconographies et d’archives pour figurer le passé, nous amène à convoquer la fiction. Une fois le décor planté grâce aux cartes, nous plongeons dans de véritables scènes de fiction, incarnées par des acteurs. Ici, ce sont les enjeux humains qui s’expriment, les petites histoires derrière la grande Histoire. Des émotions universelles qu’on retrouve depuis la nuit des temps, dans toutes les civilisations : amour, haine, trahison...";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2010:"Quand Sébastien Onomo m’a parlé pour la première fois de l’idée d’une série documentaire sur les grands Empires africains, j’ai eu la même réaction que n’importe qui : j’ai reconnu n’en avoir jamais entendu parler. Ni à l’école, ni par
mon père d’origine africaine, ni dans les médias que je consomme pourtant beaucoup, ni même au fil des nombreux projets historiques, scientifiques ou sociétaux sur lesquels j’ai pu travailler pour Arte ou France télévision. C’est ce qui m’a interpellé et convaincu de la nécessité de m’investir dans ce projet. Quelques discussions en France, notamment avec Josza Anjembé, Françoise Ellong, Daouda Coulibaly et Chris Macari, les réalisateurs(trices) de chaque épisode, et quelques voyages sur le continent africain plus tard, il m’était devenu
évident que cette ignorance n’était pas mienne, mais qu’elle était partagée dans le monde entier, jusqu’en Afrique même. Il s’agissait donc de relever le défi, de rendre compte, enfin, avec un point de vue historique mais aussi humain, des trajectoires de femmes, d’hommes et de peuples africains qui avaient été littéralement oubliés. L’objectif était en réalité double : s’adresser à la fois aux africains du continent, à ceux de la diaspora partout dans le monde, mais aussi aux autres, à tous ceux qui, n’ayant aucune origine africaine, n’en seraient pas moins fascinés par ces pans entiers de l’Histoire humaine dont ils n’avaient jamais eu connaissance. En ce sens, la forme du documentaire ayant recours à la fiction historique pour “mettre en scène” l’Histoire, que je connais pour l’avoir souvent utilisé dans mes films précédents (notamment la reconstitution historique de la traversée de la Manche de Louis Blériot, en cours de réalisation pour Arte) m’a semblée la plus  pertinente. Il fallait faire face à l’absence d’archives, mais aussi capter l’attention de ce public, aussi large que possible.

Nicole was born and raised in the slum area of Kibagare, Nairobi. She immediately was born into being a likely candidate of early pregnancies. 37% of girls between the ages of 15-22 years in two Nairobi slums have had at least one unwanted pregnancy. 	 
Nicole’s mother, Susan, gave birth to her first born, Nicole, at the age of 16. Susan too was born and raised in the slums of Kibagare. When she realized that she was pregnant, she moved in with her then boyfriend and that was how her family began. Susan’s  neighbor is her mother.  
Nicole’s story cuts across three generations of Matriarchs who have lived and grown up in poverty. 
Nicole’s grandmother, Nicole’s mother and then Nicole. They all have their lives orbiting around Kibagare Slums.  A bill to introduce sex education in Schools in Kenya was tabled in parliament. However this was met with strong opposition from religious leadership. With no sexual reproductive health information, , this then means that a girl, born into poverty, in the slums of Nairobi, will most likely get pregnant as a teenager and then drop out of school. She will then live her life, tethered to the slum.  This vicious cycle is the machinery that eventually leads to a surge of teenage pregnancies.  
 We will explore:  
1.	Nicole’s Family Background 
2.	Her Environment growing up and the influences around her 
3.	Her teen pregnancy journey 
4.	Poverty as a link to early pregnancy and broken families

Apart from losing his social and family life, now depending on therapy to improve and being part of a support group together with fellow victims, Wahinya has not yet fully healed from what he underwent when he was arrested.

In the film, he takes us on a journey from childhood to university, as he narrates how he ended up at loggerheads with the government of that time. This is not displayed chronologically but instead intertwined with scenes of this current life.

Besides highlighting just a portrait of Wahinya, the story deeply captures the pursuit of justice and recognition by the forgotten ‘second liberators’ of independence in Kenya – a pursuit that has been ignored by sitting governments for years. The film follows their journey as it unfolds, gives room for the accused to respond and finally leaves it for the people to conclude.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1195:"Wahinya wa Boore is the main protagonist of the film. He is a 66-year old charismatic man who currently resides at his rural home in Nyeri County in Kenya, and often visits his family in Nairobi. He does consultancy work on human rights and social justice issues for various organizations and also engages in small-scale farming.

He is a former political detainee and a torture survivor, having spent 6 years in incarceration and 46 days in the former torture chambers located at the basement of Nyayo House in Nairobi. And though many years have passed since he was released, he hasn’t fully recovered psychologically and also ails physically often due to the brutality he endured.

However, he is a resilient man who does not give up easily, as is visible in his pursuit of justice for the atrocities he underwent. His character embodies the spirit of the National Victims and Survivors Network (NVSN), an association that champions for the recognition of victims of human rights violations in Kenya. Wahinya is the Secretary General of the association and a firm believer in fighting for what is right. He is bold and vocal when it comes to challenging authorities that oppress people.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1636:"The film is mainly observational, where we follow our character over the period of production. We will have multiple character interviews in different locations and showcasing different experiences that our character undergoes. As we have complete access to him, the film will feature a lot of intimate scenes of his personal life at home, with family and with friends. We intend to capture the deepest emotions possible. One of the major sequences will be the annual visit to the former Nyayo torture chambers. Here, we have our character walking among other former detainees who have already formed an association together, and they freely interact, reminding each other of their experiences during those days. He also walks into the chamber where he was jailed as he describes the physical structure of the cell and the purpose for each section. This culminates into a moment where they gather together, light up candles, sing songs of freedom and make chants. Afterwards the leaders of the association give updates on how far they have gotten with their pursuits and later disperse.

Another sequence will be his frequent visits to the hospital where he goes for therapy. After checkup he goes to the nearby market where he meets his childhood friends who have great admiration for him, as we see and hear from their interactions.

Also, as the association keeps on its pursuit for justice from the government, frequent court proceedings, parliamentary petitions and protests will create a stronger narrative for the film.

This episode will focus on rugby and look at Khaya Malotana and Makazole Mapimpi. Malotana grew up in Jojweni Village in Lady Free about 20 kilometres from Queenstown in the Eastern Cape. He became the first Black African to play for the Springboks in 1999 and went on to become a respected television commentator and presenter. He has also coached numerous schools, club and university teams.

Mapimpi grew up in Tsholomnqa, a small rural village near Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape. His rugby career did not follow the typical route of most of his peers – strong school then provincial contract and finally the national team. Instead, he played amateur club rugby until he was 24 years old and was discovered by the now defunct Border Rugby Union after his club won a local tournament. He went on to play 14 matches for the Springboks and became the first South African player to ever score a try in the Rugby World Cup Final.

This episode will look at the divisive history of rugby in South Africa, and how the sport was popular in the Black communities. There will be an archival look at some of the players who were denied the opportunity to play for the national team prior to 1994. The episode will then move to Lady Free to look at where Malotana grew up, speaking to his family and friends. There will also be an interview with the Headmaster of Queens’ College, where Malotana played until his matric year. 

Another insert will be filmed in Tsholomnqa, with Mapimpi’s family and former teammates. There will be shots showing the fields where the local village rugby tournaments are held and juxtapose those against the lush stadiums where provincial rugby is played in South Africa. 

Both sportsmen will be asked about the challenges they faced growing up, their role models, how growing up in rural areas shaped their careers, etc.

The athletes’ stories are illuminated through the biographical approach, telling the stories with a beginning, middle and end. Since the athletes are alive, the “end” will look at their current endeavours and future plans. 

Narration is provided by a narrator using a third person, talking over picture montages and video clips to inform the viewer on the athletes’ journeys. The narrator acts as an observer, conveying the facts of the athletes’ lives and career experiences. 

The athletes’ interview clips act as first-person point of view throughout the film, informing and entertaining the viewer first-hand about their life and career highlights. Other characters, including family members, teammates and coaches, are also interviewed and give their own opinions on key moments in the athletes’ lives.

But a genocide creating a tribal divide, followed by a crumbling currency, and a controversial land dispute - the place Chris, Shari, and Noku call home is stuck in a destructive loop.
 
Noku is a 23-year-old hopeful and has ambitious dreams but the prospects are limited, and there is pressure for her to leave for South Africa as an immigrant. She’s also frustrated with how conversations about progress in Matabeleland are all hinged on the past. Particularly the state-sponsored atrocities that took place in the 1980s. 

Chris disagrees. Since the government killed his father in 1983 - he believes that he has been living under a curse placed by the angry dead whose bones have been scattered across the country. This curse has tainted any efforts to progress in life. Now living as a struggling migrant worker in neighbouring Botswana, Chris is adamant that only a change of guard and the reburial of his father will lift the ‘bad omen.’
 
Shari is obsessed with bones. She believes she can heal people such as Chris by exhuming the remains of their loved ones. She tries to do this while navigating her identity as a white Zimbabwean in a divided country, and the realities of her uncomfortable and violent colonial heritage.
 
Until 2017, all these desires felt impossible. But then the unimaginable happened when President Mugabe was ousted. That spurs the beginning of public exhumations. With Shari’s help, Chris manages to return his father’s bones to his rightful homestead.

But as racial and tribal tensions are at an all-time high, Chris desperately wants to return home, but not empty-handed. Meanwhile, Noku starts volunteering in hopes that she will eventually be gainfully employed. Shari faces a personal tragedy of her own; can she find acceptance in a community designed to shun her?

Will any of them be able to move forward when so much of Zimbabwe remains stuck in time?
";s:22:"characters_description";s:1986:"Chris Nyathi is a 60-year-old man living and working as a migrant worker in Gaborone, Botswana. The oldest of 11 siblings, he is the head of his family and has carried this burden since 1984 when his father was suddenly killed by the military during the Gukurahundi atrocities. Despite his efforts to financially provide and guide his siblings, he becomes convinced there is a curse on his family, which is the cause of all their economic, professional and personal struggles. When he finally manages to return his father’s bones to their rightful place, Chris still feels cursed, pandemic lockdowns in Botswana leave him unemployed and feeling out of sorts. He tries to rebuild but his new quest becomes, like his father in many ways, to return to the place he came from Matabeleland.

Sixty-three-year-old Shari Eppel started her career as a psychologist working with victims of state-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe. When trying to counsel the victims of the massacres seemed insufficient, Shari discovered the only way to bring healing to the people of Matabeleland would be to first bring healing to the dead. She does this with the hope that the future generation and her granddaughter, in particular, will grow in a Zimbabwe that has come to terms with its past. This proves very tricky for Shari who also has to grapple with her identity as a white Zimbabwean living in a very racially polarised country.

Nokuthaba Neshiri is a 23-year-old hopeful living in a largely marginalised and economically depressed Matabeleland. Her dream was to go to university, but it’s been years since she left high school and her family still cannot afford to send her to school. But still ambitious, she tries to get a job and work her way up, but the prospects for her are not promising. She wants to stay and invest her efforts into her community but she’s growing frustrated “When will it be our time?” she asks and argues that the country needs to stop obsessing over the past.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1150:"‘Healing the Dead’ is primarily told through verité scenes and intimate moments of Chris, Nokuthaba and Shari’s lives, supplemented by archival material. In Gaborone, Botswana we see Chris’ daily life as an immigrant while he carries the burden of being the head of the family and household. In Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, we film scenes with Shari and watch her navigate through communities in rural Matabeleland as an anthropologist and her life as a grandmother. And in urban Nkulumane, we see Nokuthaba active in his community. These scenes will be supplemented with landscape and atmospheric footage of dry savannah of south-western Zimbabwe where the massacres took place. This will be juxtaposed with stylistic footage of colonial buildings, vintage cars, and dilapidated factories throughout. This will provide a metaphorical exposition of how Zimbabwe is stuck in time and how the country has frayed over the years.

From this experience, he wrote a book where he expresses his hopes for his home village. With his wife Laura, a Spanish who migrated to Senegal, they developed projects around a community of young volunteers from both Senegal and Spain with their association HAHATAY.
Yaye Khadi, Mamadou’s mother, is looking kindly at the situation as they attempt the building of an ambitious community center and give a positive example to a youth tempted to Migrate. 

The film follows them in those construction and integration processes within the village of Gandiol. Will their active utopia withstand the hardships of the local realities?

Gandiol is a fishing village in northern Senegal, just before Saint Louis. On a coast dotted with palm trees, it faces the menace of an advancing sea which destroys more houses every year. Gandiol saw many young people leave, including Mamadou Dia in 2006 in a pirogue towards Spain.

Even today many young people from Gandiol envy their elders who left and returned "rich".

It is within this environment that Mamadou, returned to engage with the young people of Gandiol by setting up projects trying to fight against their departure in pirogues, and creating opportunities for them. Some remain skeptical and do not adhere to their vision, they do not understand why he wants convince them to stay.

They have their own dream of departure, one they hold dear.
Laura supports Mamadou, she also has her personal challenges in this context where she is a foreigner : her fears and doubts about the future of their family. She faces all the pressure that weighs on them every day, in the implementation of projects, the management of the community house.
After having implemented many initiatives, Mamadou and Laura are at a critical moment in their development: they are facing professional, economic and relational difficulties which will inevitably affect their future";s:22:"characters_description";s:1548:"This film is like a Sérère polyphonic song, with three Voices and a Choir

•	Mamadou, The Lead Voice

We follow Mamadou after 5 years of his return. He’s building a center of community development. How will all this impact him ? The challenges, the failures. What does returning mean to him and the people he his working with.

Sometimes Mamadou in his moments of loneliness will drive us into his utopia, his hopes and doubts. And the beautiful landscape of Gandiol and the sound will help us to get into the head of Mamadou, contrasting with the  challenges and conflict of the center.

•	Laura, The Soloist 

Laura, Mamadou’s wife, is the second voice. A Spanish woman who migrated to Senegal. She worked here, met Mamadou here, they married and she chose to commit to his project. What does it mean for her ? To integrate without disintegrating herself ? How does it impact her, her children, her couple ? Will they be able to build a post-colonial relationship ?

•	Yaye Khadi, The Rythm

The third voice, she’s the bridge between his son Mamadou and the traditional village. She is the guardian of the temple. Interviews with her and scenes will give us depth to our story and anchor it in the specific environment that is Gandiol.

Mamadou will drive us into this initiatic road with him and his people. Their song is echoing with the voicing of this ‘Choir’, all the voices of the village that will sometimes appear, whether on the marketplace or behind the empty spaces our main characters go through.  
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2008:"The desire of a “choral film” to sketch a contemporary tableau, that of a generation committed to building its dreams…

Through the character of Mamadou Dia, we will discover the situations, the characters and the challenges of social change, which is above all an individual change.

The reality of everyday situations in which we embark with him will be told through captured scenes and moments of life: my camera will follow Mamadou in his steps to move forward on his project. His team meetings, the important encounters with the village community, seeing in negotiations with authorities ...

We will Discover his difficulties and how they influence his personality. The debates and conflicts with the young people he is trying to convince. His ability to adapt to reality at the risk of losing his dream. We will film his reaction to challenges, his reintegration process.

Through Laura, I will film the interaction with Mamadou’s large family and with residents of the village, to reveal the complexity of her position, to confront perspectives, to film the process of integration. Sometimes I will isolate Mamadou and Laura to see how they manage their married life; discover them differently, in the closeness of their doubts and hopes, to perceive their fragility.

Mamadou will make us discover, the character of Yaaye Khadi, his mother; the one who advises and mediates, the bridge towards the authentic culture of the village. Her story and presence will offer moments of intimacy to Mamadou, but also a deeper sense to the life and history of this village and community

The goal is to see things from their point of view, and to follow this emotional process.

This creative documentary also intends to reflect, through symbolic images and sound constructions, the utopia that inhabits the head and heart of Mamadou, using excerpts from his book - describing his dream, filming the poetic environment  of this village to build fragments of this utopia which is activated";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:864:"In March 2021, our first filming took place in Gandiol. The purpose of this shoot was to gather images that would help building the narrative structure of the film, and test some of the aesthetics the filmmaker meant to implement.

The rough assembly we are submitting as a sample is trying to show the different elements that will constitute the core of the film : a poetical and introspective perpective to our characters and their surroundings, a strong musical presence, and a narrative embedded in captured cinema direct scenes...

Saliou Sarr worked on this sample with the assistance of an editor. Their main focus has been to put all the elements of the film on display rather than the editing process itself, which is still at its very early stages.

The return is both joyful and difficult, bringing us face to face with the reality of change, the people and places we have found again, in a new light. 
The one who returns has also become someone else, even a stranger in his own home, he will have to change again to find a place in the society to which he is returning.
This film was born out of the desire to tell a modern African story, an example of a young man who chose to return home after years of hiding to make a commitment, despite all possible difficulties.

The desire to give a voice to young people like Mamadou, to expose his dream and the obstacles he faces, a way to accompany his quest with the production of images, his desire to renew the discourse and to recreate the relationship to oneself and to others.

Through Mamadou, I wish to hear other voices around him, those of Laura, of the young people of the village, of Yaaye Khady and of the village of Gandiol.  Like a Serere polyphonic song, where the singer is surrounded by a troop of choruses that respond to his phrasing, sometimes cutting it, covering it and intertwining it as if to weave a speech with different meanings, different rhythms and melodies!

The desire of a "choral film" to sketch a contemporary tableau, that of a generation committed to building its dreams, which does not resign itself to difficulties, which opens up paths of possibilities.

My trusting relationship with Mamadou and Laura allows me to film very closely and above all to live the hopes and fears in this adventure, to observe from the inside.

To film the process of reintegration of this migrant, to show that the journey does not stop for the one who dreams and returns home, the process of change impacts first of all the one who commits himself to it in order to transform the world, without being sure to succeed.Making cinema to transform reality.";s:14:"representation";s:1866:"With Doxandem, the dream chasers, Saliou Sarr highlights one of the most important societal issues of our time. Subtly, this film finds itself at the crossroads of all these major themes that are currently dominating the debate on migration. It can therefore only be a valuable object for an audience that is too often exposed to a discourse devoid of nuances on the issue of migration. For today, it is no longer about stories, still less about adventure or Odysseus. Everything is reduced to unfathomable statistics.

By choosing an aesthetic approach, through cinema, to such a subject, Saliou Sarr becomes a witness of his time, as well as the spokesman for a youth whose voice is too rarely heard without being altered, and invites the spectator into his gaze. 

The project has just began its production. Our first shooting took place March of 2021. Additional shootings during summer and the fall will unfold. We wish to accompany that process while still looking for additional finances. 

Provided that those steps are successful and accomplished on time, we wish to complete the film for a release by the second trimester of 2022. This process had been boosted by the success we encountered in many development Lab : The Ouaga Film Lab where we were awarded 3 prices including a participation to the latest IDFA Forum, The Miradas Docs Lab where we were recipient of the Durban Film Mart award where we are set to participate in July. 

Led by our co-production partners STEPS, and with the support of the different partners of the film, this distribution strategy will be based on the integration of this project into the documentary collection Generation Africa. Its momentum will be reinforced by the submission and expected participation of the work at major film festivals around the world as well as through effective digital communication.

Through the lens of these two survivors, the documentary film, Defying Ashes, will examine, with affection and insight, what it means to experience tragic loss. Following the struggles of these two men who at the time were just boys, it will give audiences a window into the turbulent tides of the last 20 years. 
Their stories will help us understand our story as a people. Fire being a perfect metaphor for the world of tragedies and the value society (African) places on counselling and how we treat victims of tragedies. 
Leading up to the 20th anniversary of the fire, Defying Ashes by contrast will turn the story on its heels and provide a refreshing twist, by showcasing the victims perspective and putting a survivor at the center of the story. It will anchor the tale of two boys(now men) who experienced the same tragedy but their lives turned out completely different from each other. 
When did we get that way and how? Defying Ashes dares to suggest answers. It dares to probe into these people's lives. It dares to suggest that the choices we make and those made by our families and the society around us makes us who we are. 
Our documentary, though, will do more than provide historical insights. At its core, it will probe the shifting relationships between friends as their dreams and realities respond to the winds of change sweeping through their lives.

With my camera, I’m chasing, the prints she left behind, within me and my family. The Vanishing retraces the dazzle and distress of this African woman.";s:15:"story_structure";s:2013:"A woman has vanished.

This beautiful medium-sized black woman, born the year of our independence, in 1960, lived intensely: a long eventful life of 52 years, between several continents and aspirations. She is my mother.

In August 2012, she flew from Paris to Dakar, the capital of Senegal. On the eve of the Korité, the holiday marking the end of the month of Ramadan, it is presumed that she traveled towards Guinea by taxi. After that, nothing. Mariama literally disappeared.
This Essay-Documentary is not a biography, nor an analysis or investigation into her disappearance, but rather a reflection on permanence and impermanence. This film was born from the need to answer this question: "What do we leave behind?”. What traces, what prints can a life leave behind? Aside from the memories? What is really left of us and of our passage on this earth? 
This quest on my mother's personality will be done with testimonies I will collect with my camera, by retracing who she was thanks to the sensory traces she left around her on her relatives and her family. From my two grand-mothers, to her three husbands, along with my siblings and her close friends, all people that I’m filming are either members of my family or friends of my mother. Many of them have been wounded by life and society, especially the women. 
I will articulate the passage from one stage of My mother’s life to another, not chronologically, but by analogy. I will use different material such as historical and intimate archives - pictures, sound, video, and my drawings and animation to “substantiate all that is insubstantial”. 
The backbone of my film is the letter in voice over that I address to my mother. This letter is written in very peculiar tones, in which I intend to use intimacy and humor to reflect the exuberant and colourful life of my mother. 
In the landscape that is our collective memory, I’ll chase my mother’s tracks. And through this portrait, I’ll sketch the path that led me to cinema.";s:22:"characters_description";s:2003:"This film will be told in part through interviews I will conduct involving family members and friends of my mother. Here is a description of three very important of these characters : 

My Maternal Grandmother, Aissa Ly

Aissa was born sometime around the 1940s. Her exact age is unknown. She is a Peul. Her family is one of the noble families that guided the Toucouleur kingdom in Tooro. In my grandmother’s family, men are all imams or religious guides, from father to son. 

Aissa was an extremely strong and independent woman for her times and social class. A true feminist. She had seven husbands and eleven children.

My mother and grandmother never got along, but still, they could not live without each other for very long. As for me, I instantly fell in love with my grandmother. 

Today, Aissa is a plump old woman who looks more like a turtle. She does not believe that my mother is dead. She thinks she vanished on purpose, and is secretly living in the United States. She has kept many photos, of herself, my mother, and the family. 

My Father Elhadj Thiaw

My father never stopped loving my mother. He even tried to marry her a second time, when my mother divorced her second husband. Although we were separated until I was 27 years old, he was always supportive and loyal to me, when he found out my mother had vanished. He is the only one who has helped me to find out what happened to her. Both of us believe that my mother is dead, probably murdered by her last husband. 

My stepfather, Michel Roseau:

Aside from his dream of becoming a professional guitarist, my stepfather had two other passions: photography and motorcycles. He liked to shoot and print his own color portraits, and he was fairly talented. His life as a wealthy expat was smooth and easy, until he met my mother.I don’t what he thinks of the Vanishing of my mother. It’s been almost 18 years since I saw him, and we lost touch. Seeing each other again is likely to be a bit uncomfortable. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:2025:"I see The Vanishing as a drawing, a sensorial object, a tactile epic tale on screen. My film will display features akin between the personal story and the documentary essay. This hybrid form reflects the lives of both my mother and myself; in other words, our cultural blends. The shape of my film will be created from four items: 
Filmed Image: Filmed in Cinema-Verite style- the testimony of those who knew and were close to my mother. By filming them, I’m seeking in their memories what she has left to them. And piece-by-piece I will draw her portrait. I plan to interview and film both of my grandmothers, my mother’s three husbands and three other children, and her friends. There will also be archival footage to give a counterpoint with political or historical background. These official archives can be seen as a complement to what I call the “private archives” that our family has kept, of my mother. 

Photos: To collect the testimonies of her relatives, I will ask them to rely on photos of themselves but also those they have of my mother. I am seeking to emphasizes the imprint, we leave behind us, with the interplay with the filmic or photographic component when you’re in the darkroom and the image on the film slowly appears. I will often use a photo as a device, either to evoke memory and speech, or as a medium that gives life to my mother’s body over the course of time. 

Drawing: Drawing was an essential part of our life as a family. Drawings and paintings allow me to “materialize” all that is immaterial about my mother’s life. I’m using animation in certain poetic moments which are either referring to dreams, mind mood and to the non-visible world that is part of my Senegalese culture. I’m using an old handmade technique, a rostrum camera. 

Music: Music was the artistic basis of my mother’s lives and resilience. Instead of asking a composer to write a soundtrack for the film, I shall choose seven emblematic songs to make the Sound Track of Mariama’s life.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:547:"The project is still at the same phase production wise. In the past month we had the opportunity to prepare an important scouting filming that will take place in the coming weeks as well as a development workshop involving the director, the editor Niels Pagh Andersen and animator Marie Opron that will take place at the end of the summer. 

The purpose of these events is to push towards the end of our development phase and have a final scripted treatment. 

Following our production schedule, we will enter our financing phase accordingly. ";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:2004:"How will I make an invisible visible?When I examine my mother’s journey, from her birth to her late decisions, I see a never-ending struggle.

She had to fight prejudice and discrimination of which she was a victim for being a woman with a modest background, African and Black on top of it all. In societies like these, to cope with the multiple discriminations against you: you must find and create in yourself multiple types of resilience, to overcome and transcend these visible and invisible violent forces.

Violence can be used against oneself or, on the contrary, for oneself. But in every case, this energy must travel, be channeled, and pour out. Because violence is in flux; it is never static.

Every time Mariama confronted violence, she resisted with her own weapons. Sometimes with the quest for knowledge, with access to schooling and the Arts. At other times with political activism. Finally, when she dealt with even more complex forms of violence, she resorted to spirituality to survive. It guided her in dark times.

My life is a prolongation of hers. I exist primarily through the foam of her imprints. As a Mauritanian- Senegalese who lived in Europe, in the answers I mustered to resist the same struggles she endured.This is why I decided to tell my mother’s story in light of such a special prism. When I analyze my filmmaking desire, I can also analyze the rhetoric of violence and art as resilience, resistance, and redemption. 

Filmmaking and Vanishing are two opposite poles on a single axis. Vanishing means that one is no longer visible or apparent to others, whereas making this film about my mother's disappearance is making her visible to others, forever visible on a film. Implicit in the action of filmmaking is the revelation of my background. I publicly display my own invisibility: by going back to the sources of my own mysteries, demystifying them, and using the Image to reveal them. Making The Vanishing is an act of opposition to the vanishing. ";s:14:"representation";s:1994:"The Vanishing highlights the life of an invisible person, invisible by her gender, skin color, social background and history. Beyond that lies another undisputable truth : her vanishing made her physically invisible to us. She became a shadow, a ghost. This is a beautiful cinematic and human challenge. This film deals with the traces that we all leave behind and is, for that, reason meant to move audiences.

Stories of black women are starting to reach a wider audience. They should no longer dive back into invisibility. This project is a generational story that will speak to anyone interested in African communities and their diasporas. 

The director's approach is to tell us a historical resistance/fight through an intimate point of view combined with collective History, circumventing actual proliferation of set images and unfolding in several countries.

As the project is entering it’s financing phase, and after a development for which Boul Fallé Images gathered several financial supports and industry nods(CNC, Hot Docs, Scam, Ciclic…), our most recent and prestigious recognition is the Visions Sud Est award the project received at the Pitching du Réel in Nyon. To meet the ambitions of the project, we need time. Time of several shootings in different countries. Months of animation with Marie Opron, months of editing with Niels Pagh Andersen. The high estimate of budget is mostly due to the crucial importance of animation, archives and music in Rama Thiaw's vision.

Our coproduction strategy in order to finance the film reflects these realities. One of our primary goal is to make sure the film remains in majority a Senegalese and African production. The co-producers we are gathering at an international scale (Switzerland, Germany, Mauritania…), such as our first partners at Films de Forces Majeure (France) all share this imperative and the importance to make themselves useful allies in solidarity with our fight to keep our patrimony in Africa.

Glow went to a gay bar she normally goes to with her friend to have a good time, at some point in the night she needed to use the bathroom and went to the Female Bathroom. The doors in the stools don’t close properly so she pushed the door open and the lady inside pushed back at her, she knew someone was inside and decided to wait for her to finish. When the lady came out of the bathroom she asked Glow why she was using the Female Bathroom, and insisted that she should be using the Male bathrooms and this led to a verbal and physical altercation. This led to a court case that we followed with Glow which is one of the many politics that she faces as a Transgender woman in society. Through the emotional labour of fighting for her place in society, Glow continues to stay true to herself and her identity. We follow her as she gets her testicles removed, so she lives in a body that reflects who she is. We follow her in her daily life and find out the realities of no representation for Transgender people which makes her feel erased but also making it known that she will never erase herself, we see this through her work as a model and an activist. 

Olawumi Fakayejo ( 26 years old) is a Nigerian woman who was raised in a polygamous home. We find out how growing up in her home has shaped Olawumi’s views on relationships, gender roles and what a happy home looks like to her. 

Mwaka Magula (29years old) is an Entertainer from Zambia. She grew up with a father that was in the Arts and knows the power of Representation and was inspired to be in the same space herself. She is now one of the lead actresses in Zambia’s first telenovela called Zuba. She speaks about what she knows Representation for black women to be and how she wants to change that representation through the attention that she gets as a celebrity. ";s:22:"characters_description";s:1947:"Olawumi grew up in Akure, Nigeria in a Polygamous home which is very common in those parts of Nigeria. She’s the oldest of her siblings and grew up very close to her mother, and saw the effects of the divorce between her parents when her mother was removed from the home with her children. Olawumi was very close to her mother who spoke very openly about sex, the struggles in her marriage and how important it is to have sexual pleasure. We see the effects of having a sex positive mother and how it’s freed Olawumi
in her life and approach to romantic relationships. Her mother passed away shortly after her marriage from Cancer, and now she’s the closest thing to a mother that her siblings have. Olawumi just finished her first year of marriage which is said to be the hardest, and the first year without her mother. She depends on her husband financially and that comes with some politics, and we see how her Christianity affects the way that she approaches her relationship.

Mwaka is a Zambian Actress, she stars in Zambia’s first Telenovela Zuba, she has her own YouTube channel, works as a Script Writer and Journalist. She knows and understands how important representation is, having grown up with a father in the Entertainment industry. Zambia is a very conservative country, and it stops a lot of women from expressing themselves and feeling liberated. Mwaka has created a platform where she is able to do that with the women in her life, and uses her fame to let other women see her doing it so that they are brave enough to do it in their own lives.

Glow was born in the Free state and raised as an only child by a single mother. She is a Transgender woman that started her medical transition in 2016. She moved to Cape Town after she finished high school and graduated at the University of Western Cape in 2014, she wanted to work in corporate but has found it very hard to get into because of her sexual identity. 
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1357:"The visual approach of the film will be observational, walking with them in the journey of their lives to see small and big ways they contradict themselves with the things they say in interviews and the way they live their own lives. This will be achieved by following them in their family settings, the way they are at work, the way they are with their friends and the way they are when they are alone. We will focus on one issue at a time so it’s easier to link the politics they have in different contexts, because they will be cut into happening at the same time.

These three stories show Representation for black women in different contexts, starting with a lack of representation for Transgender women, to negative representation for black women, and the lack of representation again for women in African Traditional settings. These politics will be shown at the same time, as the women navigate the tension between them and the politics of sex. We will show them in their individual lives with many politics including sexual violence, the pleasures of sex, their first sexual experiences, religion, tradition, history, activism, money and sex, sex work and the LGBTIQ community in Africa.

Would he leave the only place he ever knew?";s:15:"story_structure";s:1041:"The New Man or the exploration of the intimate relationship of Man to Time; the opposition of time standing still in an abandoned village to time passing by men which confront us with our own mortal condition. The story of Quirino is also the confrontation of tradition and modernity, of man’s attachment to the Land, of his relationship with Nature. 

The story takes place on the island of São Nicolau in Cape Verde, in Ribeira Funda, a small village located at the bottom of a deep valley surrounded by high mountains and a rough sea. After a series of tragic events occurred its inhabitants taken by a superstitious frenzy abandoned the village, attributing the tragedies to forces of evil. They all left to settle in a neighbouring village, Estância de Brás. All of them...except one. A man stayed: Quirino. 
For more than thirty years now Quirino David da Cruz, 76 year old, has been the sole inhabitant of Ribeira Funda, the ghost village. 

Now Quirino is moved to the other village would he survive his new surrounding? 
";s:22:"characters_description";s:924:"During all these years, Quirino has refused help from the local authorities and friends to move him out, to these initiatives he has never ceased or respond with pride that Ribeira Funda was the land where he was born and where he will be buried. He survived all these years by fishing and getting vegetables from his own garden. He spends his days gazing at the ocean and the majestic mountains that surrounds his home. His only company is a rooster, a few sparrows and portable, battery powered radio which brings information from the rest of the world. 

But today Quirino, faced with uncertain future and the grueling weight of isolation, disease and old age, Quirino hesitates. For the first time in his life, he’s starting to accept the idea that he might need help of others to survive. However, Quirino is not alone: he lives among his memories and images of a world that existed - and that is no longer there.
";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1687:"The film follows a non-linear narration that embraces the different spaces and temporalities experienced by the main character - solitary - and the in- habitants of the neighbouring village. It will follow Quirino’s steadfast daily life, facing an environment of dizzying beauty and hostility. The documentary also follows the steep path that leads us from the ghost town where only Qurino’s radio disturbs the silence to another wold so far, so close, so full of life. The film travels between these contrasting places, and from desert to animated returns, the film explores the different points of view on Qurinio’s voluntary solitude and his desire to continue his life in the place he has always known or to move to this other place which he perceives only fragments. 
Three different approaches allow us to apprehend the soul that represents this isolation. The first takes a contemplative approach in order to capture the relationship between the character and the environment in which he evolves. The second adopts a more creative style in order to give a feel of the fantastic dimension of this universe. The narration does not hesitate to transport us to a fragmented temporality in which we come to question what’s happening on the screen: is it the present, a recent past, Quirino’s imagination or his memories that recreates the abandoned village of Ribeira Funda? 
The third approach in the extension of the previous one then embraces a more intimate engagement, more focused on the direct feelings of Quirino. 
The second part of the story is complete contrast to what our character is familiar with. This time he is the one observing the life beside him.

";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:1988:"The New Man project has crucially developed since we presented it at different markets/funds previously, Ouaga Film Lab 2020, Fond Jeune Creation Francophone 2020, EFM DocSalon Toolbox program 2021, SDI Connecting Stories program 2021, Venice Gap-Financing Market 2021 and DocA fund 2021.
Since we had an important event that happened, even though it was always considered a possibility, with our main character. Because of his fragile health and the covid19 situation that could put him in great danger, he finally left the ghost village after 38 years. For us it’s been a great challenge to adapt to this new circumstances but in the same time a blessing in terms of creative possibilities.
This new situation forced us to rethink some ideas, concepts that it was only possible with the events that happened in the past months. 
We had the opportunity to travel back to the island and capture this new reality that right away seemed much more rich and interesting. Today we have our main character living in the village of Estancia Braz, the place that almost 40 years ago the people who left the other village, Ribeira Funda, went to live. This creates a complete new environment for our character, living among the ones that he always refused to follow. But also, to live with his sister, ironically the first one that left the village, contrary to Quirino who was the last one to do so. We are now connecting with him in this new setting but also the whole dynamic of this new place. The film become a possible metaphor about transformations. The effect of time on the places and in us but also about the transformations of these places and Quirino itself. 
Since these are recent events that happened we don’t have new written material to support it but instead we edited a 15 minute sample with new footage that allows us with this visual material to show and support these new ideas, concepts, pace, mode and intentions we want to explore in this continuing new journey.
";s:14:"representation";s:1075:"-	I have been invited to apply for Venice GAP financing market with one of my projects. I applied with THE NEW MAN trusting that the project would benefit from such respected platform which will allow us to examine the international market possibilities and collect feedback for future references.  We are now waiting for the final decision which is expected during July. However, this process allowed us to explore a couple of universal themes that would make THE NEW MAN accessible to wider audiences, such as climate change and its influence on our everyday life and mind set. Nevertheless, we understand that we are navigating slightly unfamiliar visual representations of time and space that truly special to our character, Cape Verde’s islands and their inhabitants. Our mission remains hopeful that we tell a very personal authentic story in an authentic setting that full of local cinematic punctuations and conventions to attract worldwide audiences without comprising the simplicity and complexity of our character and his unique environment and landscape.

Her day is a litany of distressing occurrences, yet she is full of optimism as she fights to stop GBV.
Her incredible work is through Facebook, bringing abuses to light and appealing for help. The cases have a common thread, violence! A mother escaping an abusive husband, a rape victim in a police station… 

Her frequent Facebook postings are an indication of the rise in physical and sexual violence, she uses social media to defend and fight for victim’s rights and to link people who need help and those who can help.

The documentary will adopt a cinema verité style and will document Njeri as she goes about rescuing victims using Facebook to involve the general public in her efforts, it will follow the stories of 6 women for a period of 6 months from the point of rescue, to the unknown and uncertain future. 

By covering Njeri’s everyday life, we see what keeps her going in the face of her successes, failures and lack of concerted government support, the cost that she and her family has to bear to keep her rescue operations going, plus the sacrifices she has had to make in order to create a future for the victims.

Through her, we shall get access to supportive law enforcement officers, organisations and individuals who assist in legal matters and financially to safeguard Njeri’s campaign.
The documentary will cover all facets that combine together to bring to light the plight of gender-based violence victims, the scope is on the social, legal, economic and political aspects that have contributed to an increase especially during lockdown due to Covid-19

What has every successful person, or nation had? A chance to succeed. This is the story of an Ugandan scientist and visionary on a lifelong quest to give himself and his under";s:15:"story_structure";s:1271:"Professor Ekwamu Adipala is considered Uganda’s top crop scientist and a key driver of Africa’s green revolution; a tireless campaigner to support African tertiary education through networking, to date, 183 universities in 38 African countries. The film is his journey, in his own words, as the relentless, hard and beautiful quest to rebuild Africa's universities and give his continent a fighting chance. A journey fraught with brutal conflict, sacrifice and loss, held on course by love, resilience and African women.

Using unique personal access to the subject and his family and rare archive material of post independent Uganda and beyond, the film is both a poignant love letter to the Ugandan education system and a reflection on the experiences that shaped Prof as a person. It is a deeply intimate meditation on how to build a prosperous, unified Africa envisioned under Pan-Africanism and the African Renaissance, one small seed at a time. This is the story of African Higher Education and the urgent need to educate the world's fastest growing youth population before it is too late. Before the chance to harness the opportunities presented by the digital revolution for the world’s fastest growing economies is lost to others more skilled. 

";s:22:"characters_description";s:1878:"In 2021, Professor Adipala Ekwamu is retiring as a university professor, distinguished researcher, recipient of an honorary doctorate from University of Gweiza (Sudan) and having assisted more than 2500 students with scholarships to pursue studies in crop sciences. It’s a very different world from his upbringing as a herdboy in Olyanai, Uganda. Yet the values taught by his adoptive grandmother Ada Akello - now 100 years old - and the hard-won formal schooling paid for by the village women including the village witch doctor, are the foundation for a 40 year academic career contribution to realising a Green Revolution in Uganda and establishing an illustrious pan-Africa network for crop scientists.

The oldest of 13 children and the only sibling to receive a formal education, Adipala’s journey is from a tiny arid village through the hallowed halls of Uganda’s top schools and prestigious Makerere University to a doctorate obtained in the USA against the backdrop of Uganda’s torrid and brutal post-independence history and the collapse of education under Idi Amin and later the deplorable Joseph Kony and his Lord’s Resistance Army. 

Upon his return from the USA in 1992, Adipala sets about planting the seeds for a revitalised agricultural science revolution in Uganda that grows into a network of 10 universities across five African countries by 2004 and is set for even greater successes when the unthinkable happens: his wife is diagnosed with throat cancer. In the painful years after her passing, he throws himself into his work and expands the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) to 114 partner universities across 38 African countries. 

“Every life journey is an unfinished journey. And when you or I or anyone else is gone, there will be others preparing to take our places and carry on our work”.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1821:"This feature documentary utilises an observational and participatory approach as the camera follows the protagonist Prof Adipala: he always invites the camera and viewer into his story with a friendly “You are welcome, please come…”. This irascible story-teller, great intellectual yet down-to-earth childhood mango-thief is is the heart of the film, creating a mood of bittersweet nostalgia but with an understanding that the past is not a fairy tale idyll. Although Prof grew up in the most unstable decades of Uganda’s recent history, often brutal and violent, his vision for the growth that comes from that is infused with connection to the ideal of a pan-African renaissance, grown through networking, a celebration of diversity and commitment. 
  
The film gives us access to a mostly unseen world. With a powerful central protagonist – a natural orator - it is a character-driven story that digs deep into universal themes. Dreams, struggles, family, love and loss. An uncertain future. The story of the underdog. Our protagonist trusts the camera and is open, honest and emotional, giving us intimate access to a colourful, brutal, hopeful and brilliant life story. The personal narrative carries with it the story of a continent and it’s people. Africa’s pain and resilience through a violent past, struggles for independence and the lasting wounds (and benefits) of colonialism. We experience a new perspective on Africa’s youth, it’s tertiary institutions and the race to prepare those youth for the rapid growth and opportunity presented by the continent as the next emerging global economy. Will our protagonsit’s lifelong struggle for a Pan African youth that are skilled, prosperous and proud of their Africaness, be able to carry his baton forward? A whole continent depends on it. ";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:490:"As part of our preparation for the Durban FilmMart we are receiving mentorship regarding the narrative structure of the film and look forward to sharing the project in July. 

A shoot in Uganda is looking possible for July that will be funded through another project but we will need to schedule one more shoot in November in Benin when Prof Adipala retires - this will be a key sequence in the film. 

We continue to work on the rough cut, applying for funds and seeking co-producers. ";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:1376:"My motivation for telling the story is to reveal to a global audience, a world seldom seen. A brilliant, exciting and brutal world that challenges traditional narratives of Africa as a broken, hopeless place. A world of young people fighting for their future and the right to their own continent. I have made 58 short films for Professor Adipala and the RUFORUM Network since 2013. I’ve visited 28 African countries am deeply immersed in the current conversation about African Higher Education and it’s challenges and critical role in African Development. 
I have come to know Prof Adipala very well. And I believe I have been given rare access to his personal and emotional life. I’ve learned about the role of capacity building for young scientists and their institutions on a continent with the lowest scientific output. I’ve seen firsthand the impact of young scientists and their innovative technologies for their communities. Many times lifting whole communities out of poverty. I have seen the potential of the ‘new African scientist’ and I want to amplify that story so that the dominant narrative of Africa is challenged. 
The chasm between science and development generally, and the public requires skilful communication to cross. Complex themes need to be simplified, carefully humanised and made emotional through the medium of visual storytelling.";s:14:"representation";s:1142:"The film has benefited from extensive filming in Uganda and a 100 minute rough cut of the footage is available. We intend to return to Uganda for a final filming opportunity once COVID-19 safety considerations allow, preferably before November 2021 when Prof officially retires from RUForum as this will be a natural point of reflection for him. We hope his 101 year old grandmother Ada will accompany him to Benin for this retirement celebration as it will be the first time she travels away from her home and will showcase everything he has achieved in his career.

We are participating in the Durban Film Mart’s Finance Forum in July and hope this will introduce us to funders and co-producers.  

We hope to gain input from an executive producer during the post-production to give us input on the narrative structure of the film, archive search. We also need to rework and incorporate an archive search for the “history lessons” that reflect the changes in Uganda’s political and education landscape and the creation of bespoke music and sound design. Our main priority is to find a co-producer to assist us in this journey.

However, as every other slum dwelling, competition for a better livelihood coupled up with negative societal vices such as drug abuse, Kibera has produced several individuals and gangs that have terrorised the city in general. With low employment rates, young people have sought refuge in such vices and have in turn lost their freedom and lives in many cases. However, some have, voluntarily or otherwise, turned their lives around and sought better and legal ways to earn their livelihoods. An example of this is a group of reformed criminals who have formed a self help group, "Mwamko Kwa Vijana" that collects trash and cleans a local popular market, Toi Market, for a fee paid by the market sellers. As a group of around 15 former criminals, their main agenda is to work together as a group earning a legal income and not backsliding to crime, as well as trying to persuade peers in the night life to do the same. I met this group in 2020 and filmed their story (as the DOP) for a documentary by China Global Television Network(CGTN). The documentary is about the hidden talents, potentials and positive stories of Kibera, this groups story being a small part of a greater narrative.

Isaiah: Was a popular footballer, a husband and a father. To fend for his family, he turned to crime, mostly as a pickpocket in Kawangware. Fearing for her life after several warnings from friends and family, his wife one day left their son in the care of their neighbour, with the promise to be back shortly, never to be seen again. Isaiah's life turned around when he was caught in the act and beaten up by a mob almost to death. Right now he will do anything to ensure a better future for his son, a very talented dancer.
Biko: Frank Biko, referred to as "Chairman", is the leader of the group. He, together with several others, set up the group after he had served a jail sentence for burglary and struggled to find employment once he rejoined the free society. 
Steven: He is a silent figure who made the switch when they attempted to carjack a vehicle at gunpoint without realising the vehicle behind it was a police car. A shootout ensued and two of his friends died in the ordeal.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:488:"For maximum impact, I intend to re enact some of the situations about their former lives, eg pickpocketing, night robberies on the streets and the carjacking incident, in a stylistic way that mimics flashbacks, meaning no face reveals, only focus being on detail shots and blurred or dark scenes for added drama.

The second 2 episodes are about her journey from the current day onwards....in pursuit of peace, purpose, and meaning. In this latter part, after the sad demise of her beloved father, we will see her return to India on a quest for self-discovery. The backdrop is glamorous and beautiful; while we accompany her on her path meeting with fascinating characters. From politicians to movie stars; engaging and enjoying adventurous activities, we see her growth and evolution.

The expanse and vastness of the worlds she occupies; the intense glamour against the distinct underbelly, managing the antagonized similarities and the great differences in a quest to survive; to understand how she navigated her way, to become triumphant, overcoming hurdle after hurdle in what seemed like an endless ocean of trauma.

She would use her traditions, heritage, and culture of the continent to feed her strength, make her own set of rules and ultimately achieve what she set her mind to.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1969:"Tarina Patel, the central character of the docu-series, is the first girl from the continent of Africa who broke into the Indian film industry. She belongs to the Indian community from South Africa, and grows up in a society that holds on to a culture it brought with itself some 160 years ago. Early on, Tarina’s grandmother taught her the importance of sexual abstinence before marriage and what it requires to be the ideal Indian girl.

With this moral compass embedded in her, Tarina, embarks on her international life, in her teens. While at medical school in India, she is spotted by talent scouts and offered modeling jobs.  Soon she finds herself totally immersed in showbiz as if she was destined for it. She appears in over 100 TV commercials and on countless billboards all over the country. After learning the local language, she forays into the Bollywood film industry; starring in over a dozen global blockbuster Indian films. 

Barely out of her teens, Tarina was already living the life many can only dream of: flying first class and in private jets, living in 5-star hotel suites around the world, shooting huge campaigns and earning a ton of money. However, what actually was going on behind the scenes was the complete antithesis of this world of glamour. In fact it was a dark world entrenched in deceit, drugs and debauchery. And Tarina was right in the middle of it. 

She gets a peek into the Bollywood promiscuity and is offered the casting couch. On the one hand, she has to maintain this perfect image that she had so well-curated and on the other, she would cry inside because someone regularly violated her sense of morals. She was not just representing herself but also the name of her family, the community she came from, her culture and her traditions. She drew strength from her roots and this very world taught her to be brave and courageous. She wanted to achieve her goals but on her own terms; with a clean conscience. 


";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1580:" 
THE LIONESS is going to be a 4 part documentary feature, with each part running between ca. 45 minutes. The narrative will be from the view of Tarina, but different perspectives will be shown from directors, producers, designers, and co-actors, etc. 

Tarina will retrace her journey– visiting the places studios and meeting the people she has worked with in the past. This way the audience will get to travel with her and immerse themselves in the world Tarina works and moves. Though real-life scenes will be captured in 'a documentary' style including interview sessions with Tarina, there is scope for re-contructing a few scenes that have occurred in the past. To construct the past events we will also incorporate footage from past TVCs, films and pictures from print media campaigns. New and fresh material will be shot of Tarina's role as an actor possibly against the green screen and edited with archive material. 

The aesthetics and shooting style will incorporate glamorous high key lighting. We plan to shoot with either the Arri Alexa Mini which can be easily rigged on a gimbal or the Sony Venice which is known for its low light sensitivity. 

We will also shoot TVCs for the brands she has worked with in the past. We will focus on beautiful close-ups to give an intimate feel as well as picturesque aerial and long shots of cities and cutaways. We will have photoshoots with one of the top photographers in Bollywood. Also, we will visit the studios at Film City and possibly place her in already constructed sets and shoot B-roll and MOTs/stand ups.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:0:"";s:20:"letter_of_motivation";s:0:"";s:14:"representation";s:0:"";s:21:"representation_upload";s:21:"2021/1621192427_1.pdf";s:16:"contracts_upload";s:0:"";s:15:"artistic_upload";s:0:"";s:13:"visual_upload";s:0:"";s:12:"project_link";s:0:"";s:16:"project_password";s:0:"";s:8:"synopsis";s:0:"";s:13:"projectBudget";s:6:"326231";s:13:"financialPlan";s:0:"";s:12:"totalSecured";s:5:"15000";s:12:"totalApplied";s:6:"150000";s:11:"totalPening";s:1:"0";s:13:"BudgetDeficit";s:6:"311231";s:10:"budgetFile";s:21:"2021/1621192531_1.pdf";s:9:"proofFile";s:0:"";s:13:"contractProof";s:0:"";s:12:"ackStatement";s:0:"";s:11:"submittedBy";s:19:"Tarina Patel-Sharma";s:12:"project_role";s:8:"producer";s:10:"filmmanker";s:0:"";s:8:"producer";s:0:"";s:20:"project_co_ordinator";s:0:"";s:13:"project_role2";s:0:"";s:16:"project_category";s:0:"";s:13:"project_brief";s:0:"";s:16:"project_timeline";s:1:"0";s:16:"project_describe";s:0:"";s:12:"organisation";s:0:"";s:20:"explain_organisation";s:0:"";s:15:"briefly_explain";s:0:"";s:14:"socio_economic";s:0:"";s:10:"video_link";s:0:"";s:16:"description_link";s:0:"";s:20:"description_password";s:0:"";s:15:"proposal_upload";s:0:"";s:10:"project_co";s:1:"0";s:8:"complete";s:1:"1";s:6:"status";s:1:"2";s:5:"addon";s:19:"2021-06-25 15:00:08";s:5:"award";s:1:"0";}i:66;O:8:"stdClass":54:{s:2:"id";s:3:"403";s:8:"grant_id";s:2:"18";s:7:"user_id";s:3:"849";s:4:"name";s:18:"And who will cook?";s:6:"p_date";s:2:"90";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:8:"e_length";s:3:"60+";s:7:"logline";s:198:"A resilience story of Patricia, who does not give up dreaming of becoming a singer in Cape Verde, while she takes care of her  baby and a 5-year-old son who has inherited her degenerative blindness.";s:15:"story_structure";s:992:"Patricia, 23 years old, rehearses and dreams of becoming a singer in the city of Praia, Cape Verde. Right in front of
Senegal, the small archipelago is known for its rich musical culture, having as its biggest ambassador the worldwide

For Patricia, music represents a small haven from her reality and a chance to become famous and change her life. She
prepares herself to compete in the second season of a local singing completion tv series while she takes care of her
newborn baby and her older son that, like her, has inherited a degenerative blindness. The 5-year-old child has also
abruptly stopped talking, increasingly showing signs of autism.
And who will cook? has been a constant question in both her and her mother’s lives by the men who, after getting
them pregnant, abandoned them for being blind.

PATRICIA MAIA
Only 23 years old, Patricia is the mother of a 3-year-old boy and has recentlygraduated high school in Achada São Filipe. She is completely blind on her left eyeand almost completely on her right one.
Patricia lives in São Pedro’s neighborhood, Praia, Cape Verde. She has known rejection from a very young age: first from her father who abandoned her when she was still a baby, then from her primary school teacher, the father of her son, etc.
Even so, she managed to study through ADEVIC, she speaks Creole and Portuguese and some French and English.
Patricia dreams of being a singer. She doesn’t want to be dependent on state funds forever, and wishes to be economically independent so she can have her own house
and raise her son.
She has recently started dating someone new, who appears to be very supportive of her condition and her dreams. She is torn between wanting to be the best mother
she can be to Kenny and actually enjoying being young and pursuing her dreams freely. She attempts to do both.
She is very concerned about her son’s health and wants to try and prevent him from going blind and understand why he has stopped talking. She is the main character and the narrative evolves around her.
TITIA
Titia, Patricia’s mother is completely blind. She was also abandoned by the two fathers of her daughters. She works as Patricia’s mentor and gives us context from her birth and how she was raised.
She lives with her two daughters and her grandson, Kenny.
Titia is very active and is always busy at ADEVIC’s workshops, batuku rehearsals and doing cakes and sweets that she then sells.
KENNY
Patricia’s son, Kenny, is 4 years old and already shows the same symptoms – losing his sight as time goes by. He as also stopped talking recently, which is an alarming sign of regression. He does not have any relationship with his
father and Patricia is the one who raises him with the help of her mother. ";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1263:"“And who will cook?” will be a character documentary and will be shot mainly in cinema verité style. We will follow
Patricia while she prepares herself for “Voice One”, a local TV competition series, which will be the leading thread of
the documentary.
Sound will be immensely important in this documentary because it is the sense that allows Patricia to “see”, so it will
have to be our primary sense to be activated. If there’s a fly in the room we’ll need to hear it before we see it.
Music will also be a fundamental element throughout the film. Not only does it represent a dream for Patricia but it
also illustrates Cape Verde. Therefor it will be present in Patricia’s life in multiple ways – her humming songs, her
rehearsing for the competition, on the radio at her house, on her batuku rehearsals with other blind women and also
as a transition between sequences.
Patricia, like her mother and her older son, has been losing her sight gradually.
In “And who will cook?”, we’ll explore that concept visually through the focus. We’ll begin the film focusing exclusively
in Patricia and her family, having everything else unfocused. As the documentary progresses we’ll increasingly start
focusing on everything.

They took the first step of bravery against all odds.  They didn’t entertain the colour of their skin or their gender. They lived in a time when being black was almost a curse, yet they were able to rise above that.  They didn’t do it for themselves but for their fellow men who were despised and degraded in every possible way. They set up a stage and today many others can follow in their footsteps. 
These are stories of triumph.  Today South African women can enjoy their freedom and be able openly speak about the challenges they face but before all this, Bertha Mkhize had to be brave. She had to stand up for every woman who came before her and those who came after her. Like Bertha KE Masinga also did something remarkable when he walked into a white only SABC building in Durban and became the first black radio presenter. For the first time black people could listen to their own language and be proud. Another brave man was Simon Mkhize who ran the comrade marathon six times unofficially before he was to be recognised. He loved to run the 80 km marathon but he was black and it took longer for him to receive a green card.  Another brave woman who went against the odds, paving the way for others is Sibusisiwe Violet Makhanya. She became the first black social worker in South Africa.
These documentaries will give us a glimpse of the historical foundations to different disciplines. We shall learn about the participation of black people in different fields in the era where black people were refused participation. These documentaries will open the doors to the world and history of broadcast, sports, literature, business and social services in South Africa. This was the time when one needed to be brave in order to achieve their aspirations. These stories will be intertwined with today’s world in order to understand how we arrived where we are today.

These are schools where Bertha received her education before she started teaching. She taught until she was thirty years and called it quits in order to pursue her business passion.  SIMON MKHIZE was born in 1942 in Howick. He grew up in a farm in Underberg . He then moved to Pietermaritzburg where he started running at the age of 28.  BUSISIWE MAKHANYA grew up in Mbumbulu in KZN and like all other village girls she collected water from the river and did all other chores that were expected of her. When she was nine years old she attended the Inanda Seminary School for girls. In 1927 she earned a scholarship to study in the US. MAGEMA MAGWAZA was born around 1840 in Zululand to the Ngcobo clan. Magena was also a messenger for Colenso, sending messages to King Cetshwayo. This gave him an exposure to the Zulu royal family and he developed a relationship with the King, who he described as “good, kind and loved by his people”. KE MASINGA was born in 1904 in Mzumbe. The story of KE gives us an opportunity to explore the history of radio in South Africa. The radio in South Africa started in the 30’s from humble beginnings as a platform for the wartime report service, propagating certain ideals and values from a central source.

Ubungoma is a documentary, which seeks to educate audiences on the practice of Ubungoma, with an added emphasis on the reconnection of Africans to our identity and ancestry. The inspiration of the documentary bore from my own experiences with my former partner's journey as iSangoma/Traditional Healer & my curiosity this subject matter  & how little is known about it particularly in a younger demographic. We aim to explore the relationship between spirituality and modernization, religion & demonstrating how the world co-exist as opposed to collide.

A deep dive into the world of African shamanism.

ACT 1 – UBUNGOMA
The first act serves as the foundation of our subject matter, Ubungoma. We want to evoke emotion from the viewer straight out the gate. The establishing shot of the Sangoma dancing in this scenic view. Focusing not just on the movements but the emotion of the dancer this will be highlighted by using close up shots tightly cropped right alongside wide angles of the sunrise, which will set the scene

ACT 2:   THONGO LAM
This part focuses on educating the viewer on various types of spirits and the way they manifest themselves within their host. Showing the various distinctions and their importance showing how multifaceted it is 

ACT 3:  INKATHAZO
Here we begin to explore the legal ramifications associated with Ubungoma. We dive straight into our first interviewee, the esteemed Makhosi Dhlamini. We want to keep this footage as raw and unrehearsed as possible. Many handheld shots following her around her practice just to give it an intimate feel. Our interviews will be shot with two cameras, our main establishing shot and our second cam focusing on cutaways and secondary shots (tightly zoomed into our subject’s faces to give their stories more raw emotion). We want to keep the backdrop as clean as possible to ensure minimal distractions from the points discussed in the interviews

ACT 4:  HEEDING THE CALL
Inthwaso (initiation) is the very reason that this concept for the film came to be. Our DP, Dino Benedetti’s cinematic eye giving an interesting take on shots of Thwasa’s (initiates) going in to initiation. Depictions of various ceremonies and tying them all together to form a view from the Thwasa’s perspective. We introduce the following interviewees: Gogo Esme, Gogo Malepena, Gogo Muhlavasi Emma Kejoe & Gobelas’ from Mpande’s representing ama Ndau and Mnguni who detail their journeys as well as taking through their various practices

After an invitation to help with the inaugural edition of an African Wild life film festival, an emerging filmmaker is introduced to a world of filmmaking they have never encountered. After watching the opening night film at this nature festival called "A Plastic Ocean", their view of the world, the ocean and the anti-plastic campaigns changed.

They start to wonder about their life and their choices. They start recycling even more and using less plastic - they even almost turn Vegan. But as they ponder about this new information and as they speak to others about what they know regarding the ocean and plastic in it, the filmmaker realises that
something they hold very dear to their identity also poses a plastic threat - their hair.

The filmmaker is a hair enthusiast and hair lover, having made previous films about hair and forever finding ways to incorporate hair in any project they do. They also love changing their hair frequently using extra hair to create colourful braids and having braided hairstyles in various colours. The realisation of this conflict causes them to re-think their anti-plastic position - does this mean there will be no more braids? But her grandmother had braids and so did her great, grandmother for sure. Braids are
part of her cultural identity... how does she resolve this issue?

Through their search into the history of African braided hairstyles and frank conversations with other African women who have a close relation with their hair, the filmmaker seeks to finds the general awareness and care amongst other African women regarding issues of hair and identity and the world
and conservation.

But the habit and tradition of braiding is too hard to abandon.

Through a training opportunity where she learns how to dive, the filmmaker has yet another encounter with the ocean, this time it is up close in the great deep.";s:22:"characters_description";s:1888:"Since beginning my journey as a filmmaker, my films have had a strong focus on identity and the various sub-headings under that theme. Hair has been a big central theme and something that continues to fascinate me. My previous fictional feature film, "Hair That Moves", explored the story of a young girl who didn’t like the hair she has and does all that she can to get her hair to move like the people she sees on tv. "Rapulani!", an animated short is also about a young girl this time with a magical afro whose best friend is Rapunzel. With the new project I want to propose however, I want to move away a little from fiction and look through a more adult lense... but still continuing with my enthusiastic fascination with hair.

Through my previous and current hair projects, I have had the opportunity to be invited to various festivals and seminars to speak about hair and identity and have there met other hair enthusiast who work in this niche field. My interview list includes some of these professors and hair artists I have met
and hopefully they will also share their own personal links and fascination with hair.

With the ocean motif we want to play with, I am still in contact with an organisation called N.E.W.F. that invited me to learn how to dive for the first time and the dive instructors and would like to go back to that life (and hair) changing place. The dive instructors have open access to all the dive points in the Sodwana Bay area in South Africa so we have a lot of underwater landscape to play with. We will also
procure some archive footage from this same organisation.

The documentary is a personal documentary, using my story and journey with hair to link various themes, interviews, chapters in the film as I ask questions about the past and heritage and questions about the future that challenge my choices and the future I want to create.";s:17:"artistic_approach";s:1542:"As I was doing research into the history of braids and the hair industry, I quickly saw how this piece could easily become an investigative piece as there are many complex things in the black hair industry and of course black people's view and relationship with their hair and the historical influences - both African and
non-african is also complex. However as interesting as the facts were surrounding black hair history, I still really wanted to tell a personal story about my own journey with my hair and extra hair and pay homage to my African heritage while still including my interactions with the ocean - both onscreen and in
the real.

So I imagine the ocean, its depth, its darkness, its light, its danger, its freedom and its different landscapes becoming like a motif throughout the film. My moment underwater was quite a
transformative experience and I want to relay varying parts of those moments throughout the film through the re-occurring images of the deep sea and my hair underwater.

I also wanted to use self tapes or recordings I make of myself whenever a thought or idea comes to mind that is linked to the film's issues. I thought to do this as most of the tension of this story is really taking place internally, in my head and I don't know of any other way to reveal this. I would like these moments to be honest and not pre rehearsed so will build up a collection of self tapes with honest self discourse and see how much of those impromptu thoughts make the final film.

";s:15:"story_structure";s:4431:"Emmanuel reconnaît sans ambages son dilemme : « Si l!on me confiait la responsabilité, à moi seul, de le juger, de décider de lui appliquer ou non la peine capitale, je serais bien en peine de condamner ce tueur qui me redonna la vie, à un moment où elle ne tenait même pas à un fil ». 

La vie d!Emmanuel, 40 ans, est marquée du sceau d!un traumatisme enfoui au plus profond, qu!il exprime pour la première fois en revenant dans ce lieu- dit, Mugonéro au Rwanda, où à 13 ans, il manqua d’être massacré comme le furent, ce jour-là, des milliers de personnes, dont sa mère et sa sœur, du seul fait qu!elles appartenaient à l!ethnie Tutsi.

En réaction, Emanuel crut trouver sa sauvegarde en s!engageant dans la légion étrangère pour être résolument du côté de ce qu!il croyait être la force. De cruelles mésaventures clôtureront le chapitre de cette illusion. 

En revenant à Mugonéro à la rencontre d!autres protagonistes de son drame, témoins de ces terribles évènements qui ont fait basculer en enfer sa paisible existence d!enfant insouciant, le souvenir d!un homme surgit de sa mémoire. Un homme qui détient une clé, à ce jour énigmatique, de sa vie. Emmanuel est à la recherche de cet homme, Ezéchias Mujyemangango, un criminel, qui fut son professeur. Celui-ci se terre, dit-on, quelque part au Cameroun.

Cette recherche n!a pas pour finalité de retrouver un fugitif pour le dénoncer afin qu!il soit arrêté et déféré devant la justice. L!objet de cette quête est de susciter les retrouvailles entre une victime, enfant rescapé du génocide et ce professeur qui lui sauva la vie, envers lequel cette victime se sent à jamais une dette et auquel, par ailleurs, il veut se confronter. D!abord le remercier, même s!il n!ignore rien de ses crimes. Puis, percer enfin ce mystère, la raison qui incita cet homme à l’épargner et à le cacher. Pourquoi, il n!usa pas de son autorité pour sauver aussi les deux jeunes qui se trouvaient dans la même cache qu!Emmanuel ? Pourquoi lui seulement ? Emmanuel était-il la part du butin de guerre humain du professeur, à tout «saigneur» tout honneur ? Et les deux autres jeunes, la contrepartie de sang que le professeur devait concéder aux excès meurtriers de ses hommes pour pouvoir emmener avec lui Emmanuel ? Est-ce à ce partage qu!Emmanuel doit la vie ?   

Et cette vie sauve d!Emmanuel rachète-t-elle ou atténue-t-elle tous les crimes du professeur ? Emmanuel est hanté par ces ombres sépulcrales qui rôdent au- tour de lui depuis ce jour. Devoir la vie à un tueur, dans le contexte de ce génocide, le plonge dans d!insondables questionnements qui font écho à sa culpabilité de survivant. 

Le plus choquant dans cette tragédie rwandaise, comme en Bosnie, ce fut un massacre de proximité. Hutu et Tutsi de ce lieu-dit se connaissaient de longue date, étaient liés pour certains par des alliances familiales, fréquentaient la même église (les Adventistes du 7ème jour), avaient le même pasteur - Elizaphan Ntakirutimana -, célébraient le même Dieu et se référaient au même texte sacré dont l!un des dix commandements, le sixième, prescrit : Tu ne tueras point. Malgré cette communion, une folie collective et meurtrière s!est emparée d!une très large partie de la communauté Hutu, au point de lui faire oublier en ces quelques jours d!apocalypse toute humanité.

Moins de 24 heures après l!attentat visant l!avion qui transportait le Président Juvénal Habyarimana, le 7 avril de1994, les massacres de Tutsi ont commencé dans tout le pays, orchestrés et attisés par la Radio des Mille Collines. 90% de la communauté Tutsi est exterminée, plus de 800.000 personnes, entre avril et juillet 1994. 

En creux, à travers ce professeur, ce film dressera le portrait d!une certaine nature humaine dans l!expression de sa monstruosité triviale, celle dont sont capables des êtres ordinaires abdiquant soudain de toutes valeurs morales, recourant à la violence ou étant témoins passifs, des êtres que l!on croise tous les jours - un voisin, un collègue, un ami - cette abjection dont parle Hannah Arendt et qu!elle qualifie de banalité du mal.

À l’exemple du financier du génocide, Félicien Kabuga, âgé de 84 ans, arrêté le 16 mai dernier à Asnières-sur-Seine, sous une fausse identité, après une cavale de 25 ans. J’intègre l’idée, qu’un film pourrait en cacher un autre et me prépare à cette perspective qui obligerait à réaliser un autre film que le projet pensé. L’éventuelle impossibilité, malgré nos efforts, de recueillir l’accord des protagonistes principaux impliqués dans l’histoire d’Emmanuel, particulièrement ceux qui ont participé activement au génocide, ou de certains témoins directs, par crainte de leur sécurité, déporterait le projet du documentaire vers un nouveau sujet. L’éventuelle dissimulation des principaux protagonistes, leur fuite, leurs stratégies d’évitements, éclairera d’une lumière crue, par défaut, le sujet premier du documentaire, la recherche d’Emmanuel pour retrouver le professeur qui lui a sauvé la vie et comprendre la sidérante et effrayante ambivalence qui a fait cohabiter, la monstruosité et l’humanité, en même temps et en un même être. La difficulté d’Emmanuel à atteindre son but deviendrait alors un nouveau propos et engendrerait un autre film par effet de sérendipité. Ce ne sera pas un motif à déception ni à renoncement, tout au contraire. J’aurai l’opportunisme en bandoulière pour composer avec tout ce qui adviendra. Si le film ne s’offre pas tel qu’initialement conçu, cette dérobade ouvrira un autre champ fécond et donnera naissance à un autre film connexe…Ce qui importe n’est pas le but à atteindre mais le chemin emprunté, la démarche d’Emmanuel pour se reconstruire en questionnant et en essayant de comprendre, à travers son histoire, ce qui dans la nature humaine semble au-delà de l’entendement. In fine, c’est l’étonnante résilience et le parcours de vie d’un homme, Emmanuel, enfant rescapé d’un génocide, dont tous les actes sont marqués du sceau de ce destin singulier, qu’il m’importe de suivre et de raconter. LE DISPOSITIF FILMIQUE Emmanuel sera le fil rouge de ce documentaire. La caméra traquera son émotion au plus près lors du retour sur les lieux du drame, l'expression de son ressenti quand il sera confronté aux témoins des évènements, à la résurgence des souvenirs douloureux ; et particulièrement si la rencontre avec son ancien professeur a lieu. J'essaierai de capter ses moments de trouble, de colère, de silence, de recueillement, de larmes, d’interrogation, pour traduire l'indicible vertige de sa tragédie. Nulle voix off de commentaires, autres que celles des protagonistes. Ce sera la restitution de la vérité brute et nue. Au terme de notre longue série d’entretiens préparatoires, j’ai demandé à Emmanuel ce qu’il ressentait après avoir exprimé pour la première fois tous ces souvenirs. - « J’en tremble encore », me répondit-il. « Toute cette histoire est au fond de moi depuis si longtemps. Il fallait que ça sorte. J’espère que tout cela aboutira à quelque chose. » - « À un film », lui ai-je promis... et à sa possible reconstruction. « Il y’a quelque chose de plus fort que la mort, c’est la présence des absents dans la mémoire des vivants », me dit Emmanuel.";s:17:"rel_status_update";s:108:"Il n'y a aucun élément supplémentaire à ajouter au dossier du projet " Le tueur qui me redonna la vie".

Mon histoire avec Emmanuel Sakindi Bakareke débute avec l’amitié que j’ai nouée avec sa
sœur aînée, Consolata, à Paris, en 1986.
Lorsque j’ai rencontré Emmanuel pour la première fois, il avait 16 ans. Il en a 40
aujourd’hui. Il séjournait en France lors des grandes vacances d’été. Il était hébergé chez
mon plus vieil ami d’enfance, Georges, le frère de cœur que je me suis choisi, ami aussi de
sa sœur.
Nous savions l’épreuve tragique à laquelle Emmanuel avait survécu miraculeusement. Il
était rescapé du génocide du Rwanda. Il avait alors 13 ans. De cette histoire, il n’en disait
mot. Nous en connaissions que des bribes. Une mère, une sœur et un frère, ainsi que tous
ses amis périrent au cours de ce génocide dont furent victimes les Tutsi.
A 21 ans, Emmanuel s’est engagé dans la légion étrangère et régulièrement il séjournait
lors de ses permissions chez mon ami. Il était devenu le quatrième membre de la fratrie de
cette famille.
Après la très dure épreuve consécutive à un accident de voiture dans lequel il fut
impliqué, qui se solda par le décès d’un homme de 23 ans et la peine de prison - 6 ans
ferme dont il écopa, Emmanuel vint s’installer, après 28 mois d’incarcération, chez mon
ami, Georges.
C’est cet homme brisé, qui n’en laissait jamais rien paraître, auquel l’armée après quatorze
années de service actif avait tourné le dos, que j’ai retrouvé en début février chez Georges
dans le cadre d’un diner où je suis arrivé avec un peu de retard. Je prêtai l’oreille à une
conversation en cours. Je compris d’abord vaguement qu’Emmanuel parlait d’une
rencontre qu’il avait faite il y a 2 mois, qui semblait l’avoir terriblement ébranlé : la
rencontre avec son ancien directeur d’école de l’époque du Rwanda, un Hutu, chez lequel
il avait dîné. Cet homme figure sur la liste des génocidaires, recherchés par la justice
rwandaise. Il a acquis la nationalité française. Devenu avocat, il vit tranquillement en
famille en banlieue parisienne sous sa véritable identité.
Nous étions tous autour de la table sidérés par le récit que nous faisait Emmanuel et
étonnés de l’entendre pour la première fois évoquer cette page jusque-là tue de son
histoire.
Cette rencontre dans les environne Paris avec cet ancien Directeur d’école a réveillé les
fantômes qui l’habitaient, qu’il était parvenu à enfouir au plus profond de lui. De son récit
surgit le souvenir d’un autre homme en particulier, qui joua un rôle capital et pesa de
manière indélébile sur son destin : «le tueur qui lui redonna la vie». Un homme, au passé
lourd de crimes dont Emanuel fut témoin et rescapé, qui le sauva pourtant, dont il ignore 
la motivation de l’acte, auquel il pense souvent et qu’il souhaiterait ardemment un jour
retrouver pour le remercier et élucider des questions jusqu’aujourd’hui sans réponse.
C’est ce soir-là que j’ai proposé à Emmanuel l’idée de l’accompagner dans le cadre d’un
documentaire dans sa quête pour retrouver ce bourreau qui fut son bon samaritain.
Il accepta d’emblée.
Nous accompagnerons Emmanuel dans le lieu-dit de Mugonéro et ses environs, qui furent
le théâtre de massacres qui se sont déroulés entre avril et juillet 1994, auxquels il survécut.
Ce documentaire se présentera, pour partie, sous la forme d’une enquête policière et en
empruntera quelques une des méthodes : le retour sur la scène du crime, le recueil des
indices, des preuves, les témoignages des différents protagonistes encore vivants, acteurs
ou victimes, dont certains sont exilés, les personnes qui ont connu le professeur comme
ami, comme collègue, qui l’ont côtoyé pendant les évènements ou qui firent partie de sa
milice; toutes les informations qui permettront de saisir le contexte, de cerner la
personnalité du criminel et de le localiser.
Ce criminel, un Hutu, âgé aujourd’hui de 52 ans. Son nom : Ezéchias Mujyemangango.
Il exerçait en 1994 la fonction de professeur au collège d’Ishya où fut scolarisé Emmanuel,
son élève. La dernière information que nous ayons le localise quelque part au Cameroun,
sans autre précision.";s:14:"representation";s:2113:"
Note de production

Même si le génocide rwandais, survenu en 1994, est un drame déjà très documenté, on ne produira jamais assez d’éléments sur ce sujet (conférences, articles, livres, reportages, films, etc…) pour ausculter l’indicible. Le documentaire, Le tueur qui me redonna la vie, contribuera pour sa part, à travers le double portait d’un survivant et d’un bourreau, à éclairer ces recoins obscurs où l’humanité a abdiqué face à la bestialité. 
Avec ce projet de film, situé plus de 25 ans après les faits, loin dans le temps et si près - la blessure reste à vif - de la tragédie qui a frappé majoritairement la communauté tutsi et certains hutu, Mama Keïta nous offre le portrait d’un homme au parcours très singulier qui tend un miroir à notre humanité.            De fait, à travers Emmanuel, Mama Keita soulève ici des questions existentielles très profondes portant sur les traumatismes qui dépassent l’entendement, la résilience et ses limites, la capacité de pardon et le travail de mémoire.

Dès que Mama Keïta m’a parlé de ce projet de documentaire, j’ai aussitôt accepté de l’accompagner dans cette aventure. D’abord parce que j’apprécie son travail de cinéaste et que je sais combien les auteurs-réalisateurs de fictions sont en général excellents lorsqu’ils s’emparent du cinéma du réel.

C’est le rapport filmeur-filmé qui fait la qualité d’un portrait documentaire : la complicité, la tension, le chemin parcouru, non seulement du sujet vers le cinéaste et vice versa, mais des deux vers le film. Ici, la distance géographique et temporelle, alliée à la proximité et à la confiance que Mama Keïta a su tisser avec Emmanuel, constituent les ingrédients très prometteurs d’un dialogue cinématographique passionnant. 

Avec Le tueur qui me redonna la vie, le spectateur aura le sentiment de participer en direct à la lutte d’un homme pour comprendre la signification profonde de sa propre existence car pour Emmanuel, il doit y avoir une raison à sa survie, celle-ci doit être port";s:21:"representation_upload";s:21:"2021/1623831741_1.pdf";s:16:"contracts_upload";s:0:"";s:15:"artistic_upload";s:0:"";s:13:"visual_upload";s:0:"";s:12:"project_link";s:0:"";s:16:"project_password";s:0:"";s:8:"synopsis";s:0:"";s:13:"projectBudget";s:6:"276000";s:13:"financialPlan";s:0:"";s:12:"totalSecured";s:6:"144000";s:12:"totalApplied";s:6:"131000";s:11:"totalPening";s:1:"0";s:13:"BudgetDeficit";s:6:"132000";s:10:"budgetFile";s:0:"";s:9:"proofFile";s:0:"";s:13:"contractProof";s:0:"";s:12:"ackStatement";s:0:"";s:11:"submittedBy";s:11:"Mama KEÏTA";s:12:"project_role";s:9:"filmmaker";s:10:"filmmanker";s:0:"";s:8:"producer";s:0:"";s:20:"project_co_ordinator";s:0:"";s:13:"project_role2";s:0:"";s:16:"project_category";s:0:"";s:13:"project_brief";s:0:"";s:16:"project_timeline";s:1:"0";s:16:"project_describe";s:0:"";s:12:"organisation";s:0:"";s:20:"explain_organisation";s:0:"";s:15:"briefly_explain";s:0:"";s:14:"socio_economic";s:0:"";s:10:"video_link";s:0:"";s:16:"description_link";s:0:"";s:20:"description_password";s:0:"";s:15:"proposal_upload";s:0:"";s:10:"project_co";s:1:"0";s:8:"complete";s:1:"1";s:6:"status";s:1:"1";s:5:"addon";s:19:"2021-06-27 22:57:32";s:5:"award";s:1:"0";}}s:20:"custom_result_object";a:0:{}s:11:"current_row";i:0;s:8:"num_rows";i:71;s:8:"row_data";N;}
